McTominay ranked highest in intercepting the ball with 6 and tackles with 3.\n\nJunior Firpo had the highest number of shot creating actions with 7, compared to Jadon Sancho\u2019s 5.

Only Stuart Dallas of Leeds has the highest number of touches with 63.\n\nFrom the above heatmap, we can see Manchester United\u2019s pressure % in defensive third, middle and attacking third. We can see that Maguire had the highest number of pressure, which he applied into the\u00a0 defensive third. Aaron Wan Bissaka had applied 67% of pressure in the middle third, followed by Jadon Sancho with 62%.\u00a0 Cristiano Ronalo had the highest number of pressure, which he applied in the attacking third. It\u2019s nice to see Cristiano Ronaldo performing defensive duties too.\u00a0\nDavid De Gea had the highest number of touches, as he was kept busy by the opponents. Sancho, who had the most carries with 42%, had contributed 2 assists and he was a pain to Leeds defense. They couldn\u2019t keep up with his twinkle toes, dribbling past them at ease. Sancho and Fred had most progressive carries with 8%, as the duo combined to score United\u2019s 3rd goal.\n\n\nFrom the above dashboard, we can see that Sancho had finally come to good use. After receiving lot of flak from pundits, commentators and fans alike, we can finally see the real Jadon Sancho, who terrorized defense in Bundesliga. He already has 2 goals to his name and he had 2 assists in last match against Leeds.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-164563704983026.png","Account Created Date":"2022-01-26 08:38:16","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-01-26","Interest":"leeds united, manchester united, football, Sports, analysis, visualization","Sports Events":"Africa Cup of Nations, Australian Open","Associated Film Festivals":"Sundance Film Festival 2022, International Film Festival Rotterdam 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1062.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":332.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":28.629999,"New COVID Cases":286384.0,"New Deaths":573.0,"New Vaccinations":5871190.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Marvel Studios\u2019 Moon Knight | Official Trailer | Disney+","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Marvel Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Views":26619026.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1077760.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"From the above defensive actions we can see that Adam Forshaw had the highest number of tackles with McTominay ranked highest in intercepting the ball with and tackles with Junior Firpo had the highest number of shot creating actions with compared to Jadon Sancho s They both had goal creating actions of Jadon Sancho has the highest number of carries with and he has made touches Only Stuart Dallas of Leeds has the highest number of touches with From the above heatmap we can see Manchester United s pressure in defensive third middle and attacking third We can see that Maguire had the highest number of pressure which he applied into the defensive third Aaron Wan Bissaka had applied of pressure in the middle third followed by Jadon Sancho with Cristiano Ronalo had the highest number of pressure which he applied in the attacking third It s nice to see Cristiano Ronaldo performing defensive duties too David De Gea had the highest number of touches as he was kept busy by the opponents Sancho who had the most carries with had contributed assists and he was a pain to Leeds defense They couldn t keep up with his twinkle toes dribbling past them at ease Sancho and Fred had most progressive carries with as the duo combined to score United s rd goal From the above dashboard we can see that Sancho had finally come to good use After receiving lot of flak from pundits commentators and fans alike we can finally see the real Jadon Sancho who terrorized defense in Bundesliga He already has goals to his name and he had assists in last match against Leeds ","Translated Title":"Leeds United vs Manchester United -

As reported  earlier, the Wankhede, DY Patil and Brabourne Stadiums will host 55 league matches in Mumbai while the MCA Stadium, which is located in the outskirts of Pune, will host the remaining 15 league games.\n\nThere will be 12 double-headers this season, with the first match starting at 3:30pm IST. All evening matches will begin at 7:30pm IST.\n\nThe IPL had already unveiled the new format last month, saying that the ten teams will play a total of 14 matches - seven home and seven away - during the league phase. Ten of the 14 matches will be home-and-away games against the other four teams in the group, as well as two matches against the team from the corresponding row (organised by the seedings) of the other group.\n\nMumbai Indians, as an example, will play the other four teams in Group A - Knight Riders, Rajasthan Royals, Delhi Capitals and Lucknow Super Giants - and Super Kings from Group B two times each. They will play the remaining teams in the other group once each (for a total of 14 games) - these games will be split home and away.\n\nThe format is similar to the one used in 2011, when 10 teams featured for the first time.\n\nThe Maharashtra government has approved full-vaccinated spectators at 25% of stadium capacity for the forthcoming season. A three-day hard quarantine in the hotel room followed by a negative test on the fourth day will be mandatory before teams can enter the IPL bubble, according to the quarantine protocol distributed by IPL to the franchises.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-164658263417467.png","Account Created Date":"2022-01-24 13:06:25","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-01-24","Interest":"ipl, indian premier league, cricket","Sports Events":"Africa Cup of Nations, Australian Open","Associated Film Festivals":"Sundance Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1062.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":332.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":31.799999,"New COVID Cases":255874.0,"New Deaths":614.0,"New Vaccinations":1208921.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Marvel Studios\u2019 Moon Knight | Official Trailer | Disney+","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Marvel Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Views":25860333.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1061935.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"IPL will kick off at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on March when defending champions Chennai Super Kings face last season s runners up and former champions Kolkata Knight Riders In all league matches and four playoff games will be staged in days across two cities Mumbai and Pune As reported earlier the Wankhede DY Patil and Brabourne Stadiums will host league matches in Mumbai while the MCA Stadium which is located in the outskirts of Pune will host the remaining league games There will be double headers this season with the first match starting at pm IST All evening matches will begin at pm IST The IPL had already unveiled the new format last month saying that the ten teams will play a total of matches seven home and seven away during the league phase Ten of the matches will be home and away games against the other four teams in the group as well as two matches against the team from the corresponding row organised by the seedings of the other group Mumbai Indians as an example will play the other four teams in Group A Knight Riders Rajasthan Royals Delhi Capitals and Lucknow Super Giants and Super Kings from Group B two times each They will play the remaining teams in the other group once each for a total of games these games will be split home and away The format is similar to the one used in when teams featured for the first time The Maharashtra government has approved full vaccinated spectators at of stadium capacity for the forthcoming season A three day hard quarantine in the hotel room followed by a negative test on the fourth day will be mandatory before teams can enter the IPL bubble according to the quarantine protocol distributed by IPL to the franchises ","Translated Title":"IPL announces the schedule for the 2022 season","GeoTopic Name":null,"GeoTopic Latitude":null,"GeoTopic Longitude":null,"caption_generation":"a train traveling over a bridge over a river .","object_recognition":"['mountain bike, all-terrain bike, off-roader']","toxicity":0.32428673,"severe_toxicity":0.0000142041,"obscene":0.0057484526,"identity_attack":0.0004353076,"insult":0.25431418,"threat":0.000077373,"sexual_explicit":0.000152235},{"Dataset Index":14399,"Story Primary ID":93734,"Story ID":"STY1649928681","User Primary ID":10025,"User ID":"USR1636103491","Gender":"male","Age":25,"Title":"Juventus close to Perin extension","Narrative":"Juventus are set to complete the contract extension for Mattia Perin until June 2025.

You can get a referral from a doctor, health insurance plan, friend or other trusted source. In addition, many employers offer counselling services or referrals through employee assistance programs (EAPs). Or you can find a therapist on your own \u2014 for instance, through a local or state psychological association or by searching the internet.\n\nAfter finding a therapist, you also need to understand the costs. If you have health insurance, find out what coverage it offers for psychotherapy. For example, some health plans cover only a certain number of therapy sessions a year. Also, talk to your therapist about fees and payment options.\n\nAnd the last would be to review your concerns. Before your first appointment, consider what issues you'd like to work on. While you can also sort this out with your therapist, having some sense in advance may provide a starting point.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165930071983995.png","Account Created Date":"2022-04-25 21:59:59","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-04-25","Interest":"cbt","Sports Events":"World Snooker Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"Pan African Film & Arts Festival 2022, Atlanta Film Festival 2022, Milwaukee Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":29.91,"New COVID Cases":11.0,"New Deaths":0.0,"New Vaccinations":863847.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Watch the uncensored moment Will Smith smacks Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, drops F-bomb","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Guardian News","YouTube Trending Video Category":"News & Politics","YouTube Trending Video Views":97686146.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1435733.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"There are different ways of choosing CBT it could be that you want to try it or it could be a recommendation of any doctor the other reason could be that a friend or family member suggested it The reason could be any but you should know how to get started for choosing CBT The first step is to find a therapist You can get a referral from a doctor health insurance plan friend or other trusted source In addition many employers offer counselling services or referrals through employee assistance programs EAPs Or you can find a therapist on your own for instance through a local or state psychological association or by searching the internet After finding a therapist you also need to understand the costs If you have health insurance find out what coverage it offers for psychotherapy For example some health plans cover only a certain number of therapy sessions a year Also talk to your therapist about fees and payment options And the last would be to review your concerns Before your first appointment consider what issues you d like to work on While you can also sort this out with your therapist having some sense in advance may provide a starting point ","Translated Title":"How to get started with CBT?","GeoTopic Name":null,"GeoTopic Latitude":null,"GeoTopic Longitude":null,"caption_generation":"a group of people standing in front of a building .","object_recognition":"['volleyball', 'rugby ball']","toxicity":0.09051697,"severe_toxicity":0.0000066334,"obscene":0.001427133,"identity_attack":0.0004064415,"insult":0.06933789,"threat":0.0000341056,"sexual_explicit":0.0001160254},{"Dataset Index":83131,"Story Primary ID":135855,"Story ID":"STY1662039970","User Primary ID":81309,"User ID":"USR1661532087","Gender":null,"Age":18,"Title":"She can do BOTH...","Narrative":"She can do BOTH...","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166203995476907.png","Account Created Date":"2022-08-26 22:11:27","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-08-26","Interest":"Technology, History, Food, Entertainment, Sports, Environment, Science, Inequality, Education, Health, Politics, Economy, Climate change ","Sports Events":"World Volleyball Championships (men)","Associated Film Festivals":null,"Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_3","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1128.48,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":363.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":10.67,"New COVID Cases":9520.0,"New Deaths":41.0,"New Vaccinations":3151893.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"BLACKPINK - \u2018Pink Venom\u2019 M\/V","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"BLACKPINK","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Music","YouTube Trending Video Views":197737330.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":11803001.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"it","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"it","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"She can do BOTH","Translated Title":"She can do BOTH...","GeoTopic Name":null,"GeoTopic Latitude":null,"GeoTopic Longitude":null,"caption_generation":"a man holding a frisbee in his hands .","object_recognition":"['valley, vale', 'volcano']","toxicity":0.0004491403,"severe_toxicity":0.0000013332,"obscene":0.0000393998,"identity_attack":0.0000667024,"insult":0.0001364596,"threat":0.0000155653,"sexual_explicit":0.0000163442},{"Dataset Index":43709,"Story Primary ID":88362,"Story ID":"STY1647745902","User Primary ID":28643,"User ID":"USR1646121145","Gender":null,"Age":80,"Title":"Fate conspired and I sat for AIIMS entrance","Narrative":"I liked school.

incoming college students use a different set of pronouns. That\u2019s according to\u00a0my analysis\u00a0of the more than 1.2 million applications submitted for the 2022-23 school year through the\u00a0Common App, an online application platform used by more than 900 colleges.\n\nWhile 3% may not seem like a lot, it represents nearly 37,000 students. It is also indicative of a growing number of young people who identify outside of a gender binary \u2013 that is, they do not identify as female or male. For example, the percentage of college students who indicated that they are nonbinary on one national survey has nearly tripled from\u00a01.4%\u00a0in 2016 to\u00a04.1%\u00a0in 2021.\n\nBeyond the binary\n\nIn analyzing the data from the Common App, I found that 2.2% of students \u2013 more than 26,000 individuals \u2013 who applied to college for this fall identified as transgender or nonbinary. This figure is likely an undercount because some students may be reluctant to indicate their gender identity on an admissions form. For instance, students often complete their college applications with their families and are unlikely to state that they are trans or nonbinary if they are not out to them.\n\nThe leaders of the Common App provided me with data from the college applications for the 2022-23 school year so that I could analyze how students today identify their gender and what pronouns they use. Students\u2019 names and other identifying information were withheld.\n\nIn looking at how students named their gender and pronouns on the Common App, two contrasting trends stood out to me.\n\nOne is the number of ways that nonbinary students have developed to describe their gender. Whereas trans people used relatively few gender identity labels for themselves\u00a0when I came out as nonbinary in the late 1990s, these students provided approximately 130 different genders and about 78 different pronoun sets \n\nRead more: https:\/\/theconversation.com\/college-students-are-increasingly-identifying-beyond-she-and-he-187338","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166097765677286.png","Account Created Date":"2022-04-20 11:35:32","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-04-20","Interest":"the conversation","Sports Events":"Invictus Games, World Snooker Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"Pan African Film & Arts Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":30.76,"New COVID Cases":2380.0,"New Deaths":56.0,"New Vaccinations":744947.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Watch the uncensored moment Will Smith smacks Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, drops F-bomb","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Guardian News","YouTube Trending Video Category":"News & Politics","YouTube Trending Video Views":97122193.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1427129.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"When students today fill out their college applications they are not just identifying as she or he More than of incoming college students use a different set of pronouns That s according to my analysis of the more than million applications submitted for the school year through the Common App an online application platform used by more than colleges While may not seem like a lot it represents nearly students It is also indicative of a growing number of young people who identify outside of a gender binary that is they do not identify as female or male For example the percentage of college students who indicated that they are nonbinary on one national survey has nearly tripled from in to in Beyond the binary In analyzing the data from the Common App I found that of students more than individuals who applied to college for this fall identified as transgender or nonbinary This figure is likely an undercount because some students may be reluctant to indicate their gender identity on an admissions form For instance students often complete their college applications with their families and are unlikely to state that they are trans or nonbinary if they are not out to them The leaders of the Common App provided me with data from the college applications for the school year so that I could analyze how students today identify their gender and what pronouns they use Students names and other identifying information were withheld In looking at how students named their gender and pronouns on the Common App two contrasting trends stood out to me One is the number of ways that nonbinary students have developed to describe their gender Whereas trans people used relatively few gender identity labels for themselves when I came out as nonbinary in the late s these students provided approximately different genders and about different pronoun sets Read more ","Translated Title":"College students are increasingly identifying beyond \u2018she\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018he\u2019","GeoTopic Name":null,"GeoTopic Latitude":null,"GeoTopic Longitude":null,"caption_generation":"a group of people sitting on a couch .","object_recognition":"['crutch', 'unicycle, monocycle']","toxicity":0.00237969,"severe_toxicity":0.0000029443,"obscene":0.0000828568,"identity_attack":0.0001332012,"insult":0.0006287726,"threat":0.0000600054,"sexual_explicit":0.0000497284},{"Dataset Index":18938,"Story Primary ID":92566,"Story ID":"STY1649406214","User Primary ID":11460,"User ID":"USR1637921462","Gender":"male","Age":36,"Title":"Conference League: la Roma perde l\u2019andata in Norvegia","Narrative":"Tra una settimana si decider\u00e0 tutto.

Muthok Khongmawloh, the club's founder, wanted children to have holistic development where they balanced academics with sports and physical activity.\n\nThe club has transformed many lives and has successfully organised a tournament called the Riwar Cup. The Riwar cup was the largest organised football tournament in the area and was attended by several young players from surrounding regions. It saw 198 children participating in the games and had other camp facilities provided to the players during their stay.\u00a0\n\nThe Little Star Football club has won several local games, and the club managers ensure that the village children can attend as many tournaments as possible. Finances become a problem because sponsoring sports kits and travel arrangements are expensive. Hiring coaches to train the village children are an added expense too. However, Muthok\u2019s indomitable spirit has made it possible to run the club for so long. He says the club has a bright future and is grateful for the encouragement and support he received from the village and his elders. He likes to see families in the village happy because their children are getting to live a happy and active childhood with access to opportunities they might not get otherwise.\n\nMuthok has several plans for the club. He wants to take the children to more tournaments at the national level and have formal practice sessions with expert coaches. He also wants to extend the club activities to more villages, sponsor more kits and guide talented children to become professional players.\n\nSupport Muthok\u2019s cause and share his success story to support the club and how it is transforming lives.

Most homes don\u2019t have air conditioning, and even health clinics can get overheated.\n\nThese countries tend to be in the hottest parts of world, and their risk of dangerous heat waves is rising as the planet warms.\n\nIn a new study, our team of climate scientists, economists and engineers found that the poorest parts of the world are likely to be two to five times more exposed to heat waves than richer countries by the 2060s. By the end of the century, the lowest-income quarter of the global population\u2019s heat exposure will almost match that of the entire rest of the world.\n\nCapacity to adapt to rising heat is crucial\n\nHeat waves are often assessed by how frequent or intense they are, but vulnerability involves more than that.\n\nA key factor in the amount of harm heat waves cause is people\u2019s capacity to adapt with measures like cooling technology and the power to run it.\n\nTo assess how heat wave exposure is changing, we analyzed heat waves around the world over the past 40 years and then used climate models to project ahead. Importantly, we also incorporated estimates of countries\u2019 ability to adapt to rising temperatures and lower their heat exposure risk.\n\nWe found that while wealthy countries can buffer their risk by rapidly investing in measures to adapt to climate change, the poorest quarter of the world \u2013 areas likely to be slower to adapt \u2013 will face escalating heat risk.\n\nRead full story at The Conversation: https:\/\/theconversation.com\/heat-waves-hit-the-poor-hardest-a-new-study-calculates-the-rising-impact-on-those-least-able-to-adapt-to-the-warming-climate-175224\n\nImage Credits: https:\/\/www.gettyimages.com\/detail\/news-photo\/indian-migrant-workers-rest-in-the-shadow-of-a-transport-news-photo\/156543327","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-164456390342336.jpeg","Account Created Date":"2021-03-05 10:52:00","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-03-05","Interest":"heat wave, heat waves, climate change, climate, climate crisis, climate action, climate activist, heat, heat-related deaths, poverty, poverty and inequality, low income","Sports Events":"Six Nations, Nordic World Ski Championships","Associated Film Festivals":"Glasgow Film Festival, Dublin International Film Festival, Miami Film Festival, New York International Children\u2019s Film Festival","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":770.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":280.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":57.43,"New COVID Cases":18284.0,"New Deaths":108.0,"New Vaccinations":1492201.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"ANUEL AA, @Ozuna -

Movie So Much Better- 1","Narrative":"Devil's wear prada- Meryl Streep asked that passages be included to the script that go beyond just highlighting the accomplishments and anger of her character. One of these moments was Andy going into Miranda's room and finding her sobbing because her husband had requested a divorce. In an interview with Variety magazine, Streep stated, \"I wanted a sequence when she is without her armour, the unpeeled scene in the hotel room \u2014 simply to see her face without its protective gloss, to glance at the woman in the businesswoman.\n\nThe witcher - In the second season, Geralt discovers that the person he believed to be dead\u2014his beloved\u2014is actually still alive. Henry Cavill, the lead actor, and Anya Chalotra, who portrayed Yennefer, persuaded the filmmakers to redo their characters' reunion moment, concentrating entirely on feelings, according to an interview with Cavill. So, during the moment, the actors just kissed.\n\nFast and furious -Michelle Rodriguez, the series' leading lady, came close to quitting the project during the first film's production because of the scene in which her character was forced to cheat on her partner with another guy. The actor declined to do this part since she thought the action was very absurd and unacceptable. Rodriguez said that she even sobbed.Vin Diesel, who played her movie companion, stood by her. \"While I was sobbing, he pulled me away, looked me in the eye, and promised to take care of me. I'll handle everything, don't worry,\" the actress said. And indeed, this is what took place.\n\nPulp fiction - Jules was planned to have an afro to contrast with his colleague Vincent's neat hair in the original screenplay (John Travolta). However, Quentin Tarantino's assistant misinterpreted the assignment and purchased the wig that was ultimately seen on-screen. Despite Tarantino's initial opposition, Samuel L. Jackson persisted on modifying the appearance of his character because he loved the way the wig looked.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165919599666073.png","Account Created Date":"2021-11-26 11:18:00","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-11-26","Interest":"script, pulp fiction, devils wear prada, Entertainment, hollywood, fast n furious, hollywood actors, the witcher","Sports Events":"World Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"French Film Festival, Made In Prague Festival, Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, International Documentary Festival Amsterdam","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_4","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1297.89,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":319.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":49.759998,"New COVID Cases":8318.0,"New Deaths":465.0,"New Vaccinations":12229439.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"$456,000 Squid Game In Real Life!","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"MrBeast","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Views":55419453.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":6284727.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Devil s wear prada Meryl Streep asked that passages be included to the script that go beyond just highlighting the accomplishments and anger of her character One of these moments was Andy going into Miranda s room and finding her sobbing because her husband had requested a divorce In an interview with Variety magazine Streep stated I wanted a sequence when she is without her armour the unpeeled scene in the hotel room simply to see her face without its protective gloss to glance at the woman in the businesswoman The witcher In the second season Geralt discovers that the person he believed to be dead his beloved is actually still alive Henry Cavill the lead actor and Anya Chalotra who portrayed Yennefer persuaded the filmmakers to redo their characters reunion moment concentrating entirely on feelings according to an interview with Cavill So during the moment the actors just kissed Fast and furious Michelle Rodriguez the series leading lady came close to quitting the project during the first film s production because of the scene in which her character was forced to cheat on her partner with another guy The actor declined to do this part since she thought the action was very absurd and unacceptable Rodriguez said that she even sobbed Vin Diesel who played her movie companion stood by her While I was sobbing he pulled me away looked me in the eye and promised to take care of me I ll handle everything don t worry the actress said And indeed this is what took place Pulp fiction Jules was planned to have an afro to contrast with his colleague Vincent s neat hair in the original screenplay John Travolta However Quentin Tarantino s assistant misinterpreted the assignment and purchased the wig that was ultimately seen on screen Despite Tarantino s initial opposition Samuel L Jackson persisted on modifying the appearance of his character because he loved the way the wig looked ","Translated Title":"Actors Refused to Follow the Script and Made the Movie So Much Better- 1","GeoTopic Name":null,"GeoTopic Latitude":null,"GeoTopic Longitude":null,"caption_generation":"a man holding a tennis racquet on a tennis court .","object_recognition":"['pier', 'container ship, containership, container vessel']","toxicity":0.0003983908,"severe_toxicity":0.0000013218,"obscene":0.00004204,"identity_attack":0.0000794742,"insult":0.0001231088,"threat":0.0000132059,"sexual_explicit":0.0000138447},{"Dataset Index":87284,"Story Primary ID":151756,"Story ID":"STY1664818603","User Primary ID":87206,"User ID":"USR1662371239","Gender":null,"Age":21,"Title":"National Games 2022: Athletics Results - 3rd October, 2022","Narrative":"\nMen's Discuss Throw\n1.

Un caso che \u00e8 gi\u00e0 stato definito controverso perch\u00e9 la volont\u00e0 del giudice non rispecchia quella dei genitori. La vicenda \u00e8 legata alla vita di  Archie Battersbee, 12 anni - trovato privo di conoscenza in casa a Southend,  nell'Essex,  il 7 aprile scorso. Archie \u00e8 in coma irreversibile e un giudice delll'Alta Corte di Londra ha decretato in primo grado, dopo aver ascoltato il parere dei medici che dicono che non c'\u00e8 possibilit\u00e0 di ripresa per il dodicenne, che bisogna staccare la spina.  L'equipe del Royal London Hospital che ha in cura il bambino, stando a quanto stabilito dal giudice, ha presentato elementi sufficienti a sostegno della convinzione secondo cui una diagnosi irreversibile di morte delle cellule cerebrali appare a questo punto \"altamente probabile\".   Sono stati i medici a rivolgersi alla magistratura di fronte alla contrariet\u00e0 dei familiari che invece vorrebbero tenere in vita artificialmente il bambino e hanno deciso di fare ricorso. Hollie Dance, la mamma, ma parlato cos\u00ec:  \"Sono devastata ed estremamente delusa dalla sentenza emessa oggi dopo settimane di battaglia legale e intendo restare accanto al letto di mio figlio. Il mio istinto di mamma mi dice che Archie \u00e8 ancora qui\". \"Non basta una diagnosi di morte probabile\", ha aggiunto \" sono disgustata dall'atteggiamento del giudice e dei medici visto che  il cuore di Archie batte ancora e\" ha concluso  \"mi ha stretto la mano\".  \nVoi come la pensate?

Yet, it has been able to hold off well-armed military forces.As a sociologist who has written extensively on the cultures of nationalism in the region, I have studied the deep and complex roots of this conflict. I believe that understanding its history is key to comprehending how Tigray has developed the resolve to hold off a far greater military might than its own.Neither the leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea nor those of Tigray accept the principles of compromise, peaceful coexistence or equal partnership.

The Ethiopian army was helped by Eritrean and Amhara military forces.Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister, congratulated his army and allied forces for what looked like a quick victory.However, the Tigrayan Defence Force made a tactical retreat. Its troops moved to rural areas and used guerrilla operations supported by war veterans. This strategy demonstrated Tigray\u2019s effective fighting force, which was first developed in the 1970s.As a result, eight months after the start of the war, Tigrayan troops returned to their capital. The Ethiopian army retreated from Mekelle and other cities.Tigrayan troops then invaded the neighbouring Afar and Amhara regions, and almost made it into Finfinnee (Addis Ababa) in November 2021. However, they soon retreated to their region.Since then, Tigrayan forces have controlled and administered most of Tigray.Read more: https:\/\/theconversation.com\/tigray-has-resisted-ethiopias-far-greater-military-might-for-two-years-heres-why-neither-side-is-giving-in-192252","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166599023850677.jpeg","Account Created Date":"2022-04-20 11:35:32","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-04-20","Interest":"Technology, History, Food, Entertainment, Sports, Environment, Science, Inequality, Education, Health, Politics, Economy, Climate change ","Sports Events":"Invictus Games, World Snooker Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"Pan African Film & Arts Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":30.76,"New COVID Cases":2380.0,"New Deaths":56.0,"New Vaccinations":744947.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Watch the uncensored moment Will Smith smacks Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, drops F-bomb","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Guardian News","YouTube Trending Video Category":"News & Politics","YouTube Trending Video Views":97122193.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1427129.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"The Ethio Tigray war started on November For almost two years the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea along with Amhara regional forces and militia have waged war against Tigray s regional government and society Tigray is a tiny ethnonational group that makes up about of Ethiopia s population of million Yet it has been able to hold off well armed military forces As a sociologist who has written extensively on the cultures of nationalism in the region I have studied the deep and complex roots of this conflict I believe that understanding its history is key to comprehending how Tigray has developed the resolve to hold off a far greater military might than its own Neither the leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea nor those of Tigray accept the principles of compromise peaceful coexistence or equal partnership According to their political cultures winners take all It s zero sum politics Get your news from people who know what they re talking about Get newsletterThe war todayThe Ethiopian National Defence Force captured Mekelle Tigray s capital city on November The Ethiopian army was helped by Eritrean and Amhara military forces Abiy Ahmed Ethiopia s prime minister congratulated his army and allied forces for what looked like a quick victory However the Tigrayan Defence Force made a tactical retreat Its troops moved to rural areas and used guerrilla operations supported by war veterans This strategy demonstrated Tigray s effective fighting force which was first developed in the s As a result eight months after the start of the war Tigrayan troops returned to their capital The Ethiopian army retreated from Mekelle and other cities Tigrayan troops then invaded the neighbouring Afar and Amhara regions and almost made it into Finfinnee Addis Ababa in November However they soon retreated to their region Since then Tigrayan forces have controlled and administered most of Tigray Read more ","Translated Title":"Tigray has resisted Ethiopia\u2019s far greater military might for two years \u2013 here\u2019s why neither side","GeoTopic Name":"Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia","GeoTopic Latitude":9.0,"GeoTopic Longitude":39.5,"caption_generation":"a group of people sitting on top of a bench .","object_recognition":"['microphone, mike', 'Windsor tie']","toxicity":0.0007234373,"severe_toxicity":0.0000010726,"obscene":0.0000374979,"identity_attack":0.0000719242,"insult":0.0002408378,"threat":0.000015371,"sexual_explicit":0.0000128174},{"Dataset Index":25031,"Story Primary ID":75127,"Story ID":"STY1642935359","User Primary ID":14992,"User ID":"USR1641231517","Gender":null,"Age":19,"Title":"Mandala","Narrative":"The mandala is a map for spiritual transformation","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-164278797367881.png","Account Created Date":"2022-01-03 23:08:37","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-01-03","Interest":"meraki","Sports Events":null,"Associated Film Festivals":null,"Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1062.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":332.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":46.59,"New COVID Cases":37379.0,"New Deaths":124.0,"New Vaccinations":7939936.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Jessica Darrow -

The team went on to register a win on the final day to steer clear of 18th place Burnley. Throughout the struggles, few players stuck with the club. Amongst them, Stuart Dallas is one of the prominent footballers. For his valiant and strong performances on the pitch, the player is getting praises from the several legends of the game. The player is now even getting compared to the Liverpool legend, James Milner.\u00a0\n\nFormer Leeds United player and legend, Matteo, talking to the Yorkshire Evening Post, compared the player to the Merseysider captain:\u00a0\n\n\u201cJust look at how he [Milner] has played at right-back when Klopp has used him there, against world class players.\n\n\nNo one has an easy game against him.\u00a0\n\nWhen Trent [Alexander-Arnold] has got an injury and Milner has been up against someone with a bit of ability, he can have them in his pocket. He understands the position. Whenever he steps in, he\u2019s a bit like Stuey Dallas, he doesn\u2019t change the way he thinks about the game, he just adapts and he can adapt a lot quicker than some people.\u00a0\n\nSome people would take two or three games to get used to a position, he\u2019s straight back into it.\u201d\n\nFollowing his impressive performances on the pitch, the player is linked with a move to multiple English Premier League clubs. However, the player is determined to play for the Whites under Jesse Marsch in 2022\/23. It remains interesting to see if Leeds United can keep hold of their player.\n\nOn the other hand, Liverpool have handed James Milner a year-long contract extension after much demand by Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool faithfuls.

A Question of Pride : Sino-India Boundary Negotiations","Narrative":"The Sino-Indian Boundary Issue continues .....\n\nIn November 1975 India\u2019s Eastern Army Commander (the GOC-in-C Eastern Command), Lieut.-General J.F.R. Jacob , tasked this author to brief the Indian Prime Minister (PM), Mrs. Indira Gandhi, on the Sino-Indian boundary issue in the eastern sector. The briefing was to explain on a current map the original McMahon Line (as defined by the names of places on the original McMahon map and in the written description of the delimitation), the Line of \nActual Control, the Chinese Claim Line, and India\u2019s perception of the international Sino Indian border (i.e., India\u2019s official interpretation of the McMahon Line) as printed on the Indian maps. The briefing took place in the library of the Raj Bhawan in Gangtok, on a marked map showing all the various lines and their inter-relationship with each other. \n\nThe validity of each country\u2019s claims, as evidenced from the modern cartographicpositioning of the reference points named in the McMahon Line document on to current maps, was explained and discussed. It was pointed out to the PM that there was some merit in certain aspects of the Chinese claims, and that their point of view perhaps therefore ought not to be rejected out of hand. The only persons present were the PM, the Army Commander, and this author. After this author had briefed the PM, she asked him what he thought ought to be done about the existing anomalies. His reply was that the implications were of such a level that made it a matter for the PM to discuss with her cabinet colleagues and with the Ministry of External Affairs. The PM merely smiled in response and said, \u2018I see\u2019.\n\nIt is likely that this briefing was an early step in a chain of events and decision-making that led to India\u2019s appointing an Ambassador to China again, after a gap of 14 years. In February 1976, Mrs. Indira Gandhi broke the ice by appointing an Indian ambassador to Beijing. China \nreciprocated by sending an ambassador to India after 15 years, and relations improved substantially. Official-level talks on the boundary dispute began in 1981.\n\nTo be continued....","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-16461332091919.png","Account Created Date":"2022-01-03 16:16:00","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-01-03","Interest":"a question of pride, books","Sports Events":null,"Associated Film Festivals":null,"Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1062.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":332.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":46.59,"New COVID Cases":37379.0,"New Deaths":124.0,"New Vaccinations":7939936.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Jessica Darrow - Surface Pressure (From Encanto)","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"DisneyMusicVEVO","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Music","YouTube Trending Video Views":28324581.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":383343.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"The Sino Indian Boundary Issue continues In November India s Eastern Army Commander the GOC in C Eastern Command Lieut General J F R Jacob tasked this author to brief the Indian Prime Minister PM Mrs Indira Gandhi on the Sino Indian boundary issue in the eastern sector The briefing was to explain on a current map the original McMahon Line as defined by the names of places on the original McMahon map and in the written description of the delimitation the Line of Actual Control the Chinese Claim Line and India s perception of the international Sino Indian border i e India s official interpretation of the McMahon Line as printed on the Indian maps The briefing took place in the library of the Raj Bhawan in Gangtok on a marked map showing all the various lines and their inter relationship with each other The validity of each country s claims as evidenced from the modern cartographicpositioning of the reference points named in the McMahon Line document on to current maps was explained and discussed It was pointed out to the PM that there was some merit in certain aspects of the Chinese claims and that their point of view perhaps therefore ought not to be rejected out of hand The only persons present were the PM the Army Commander and this author After this author had briefed the PM she asked him what he thought ought to be done about the existing anomalies His reply was that the implications were of such a level that made it a matter for the PM to discuss with her cabinet colleagues and with the Ministry of External Affairs The PM merely smiled in response and said I see It is likely that this briefing was an early step in a chain of events and decision making that led to India s appointing an Ambassador to China again after a gap of years In February Mrs Indira Gandhi broke the ice by appointing an Indian ambassador to Beijing China reciprocated by sending an ambassador to India after years and relations improved substantially Official level talks on the boundary dispute began in To be continued ","Translated Title":"5.

In both Sweden and Australia the rates of breastfeeding initiation are high. However, overall there is limited information about the breastfeeding practices of women with T1DM and the factors affecting them. Similarities in demographics, birth rates and health systems create bases for discussion.\n\nAim\n\nThe aim of this paper is to discuss psychosocial factors, policies and practices that impact on the breastfeeding practices of women with T1DM.\n\nFindings\n\nSwedish research indicates that the overall breastfeeding rate in women with T1DM remains significantly lower than in women without diabetes in the first 2 and 6 months after childbirth with no differences in exclusive breastfeeding. Breastfeeding initiation and continuation among women with T1DM in Sweden has been shown to be influenced by health services delivery, supportive breastfeeding polices and socio-economic factors, particular perceived support from social networks and health professionals.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is limited research on the impact of attitudes towards breastfeeding, emotional and social well-being and diabetes-related stress on the decision of women with T1DM to initiate and continue to breastfeed for at least 6 months. A more comprehensive understanding of the breastfeeding practices and psychosocial factors operating during the first 6 months after birth for women with T1DM will be instrumental in the future design of interventions promoting initiation and continuation of breastfeeding in Sweden, Australia and elsewhere.\n\nSources - https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S1871519214000997","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165960637791191.png","Account Created Date":"2021-11-11 17:32:00","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-11-11","Interest":"breastfeeding week, diabetes","Sports Events":"ICC World T20 (men)","Associated Film Festivals":"French Film Festival, Thessaloniki International Film Festival, European Film Forum SCANORAMA, London Korean Film Festival, Geneva International Film Festival, Cork International Film Festival, Made In Prague Festival, American Film Festival, Stockholm International Film Festival, DOC NYC","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_4","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1297.89,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":319.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":53.290001,"New COVID Cases":12516.0,"New Deaths":501.0,"New Vaccinations":4969221.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, Silk Sonic - Smokin Out The Window [Official Music Video]","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Bruno Mars","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Music","YouTube Trending Video Views":23035962.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":925761.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Abstract Background Women with type diabetes T DM face many challenges during their pregnancy birth and in the postnatal period including breastfeeding initiation and continuation while maintaining stable glycaemic control In both Sweden and Australia the rates of breastfeeding initiation are high However overall there is limited information about the breastfeeding practices of women with T DM and the factors affecting them Similarities in demographics birth rates and health systems create bases for discussion Aim The aim of this paper is to discuss psychosocial factors policies and practices that impact on the breastfeeding practices of women with T DM Findings Swedish research indicates that the overall breastfeeding rate in women with T DM remains significantly lower than in women without diabetes in the first and months after childbirth with no differences in exclusive breastfeeding Breastfeeding initiation and continuation among women with T DM in Sweden has been shown to be influenced by health services delivery supportive breastfeeding polices and socio economic factors particular perceived support from social networks and health professionals Conclusion There is limited research on the impact of attitudes towards breastfeeding emotional and social well being and diabetes related stress on the decision of women with T DM to initiate and continue to breastfeed for at least months A more comprehensive understanding of the breastfeeding practices and psychosocial factors operating during the first months after birth for women with T DM will be instrumental in the future design of interventions promoting initiation and continuation of breastfeeding in Sweden Australia and elsewhere Sources ","Translated Title":"Breastfeeding practices in women with type 1 diabetes","GeoTopic Name":"Kingdom of Sweden","GeoTopic Latitude":62.0,"GeoTopic Longitude":15.0,"caption_generation":"a sign that is on top of a pole .","object_recognition":"['French horn, horn', 'ocarina, sweet potato']","toxicity":0.0005440924,"severe_toxicity":0.000001382,"obscene":0.0000431406,"identity_attack":0.0000714299,"insult":0.0001631066,"threat":0.0000169826,"sexual_explicit":0.0000158465},{"Dataset Index":48186,"Story Primary ID":86499,"Story ID":"STY1646925849","User Primary ID":28847,"User ID":"USR1646865414","Gender":null,"Age":44,"Title":"Satirist turned politician Bhagwant Mann is all set to be the 17th Chief Minister of Punjab","Narrative":"Satirist turned politician Bhagwant Mann is all set to be the 17th Chief Minister of Punjab\u00a0\n\nWith Aam Aadmi Party registering\u00a0 a landslide victory\u00a0 in the 2022 Punjab vidhan sabha elections, satirist turned politician Bhagwant Mann is all set to be the 17th Chief Minister of the state.\n\nOurt of 117 seats, AAP won 92 seats, reducing\u00a0 Congress to just 18 and decimating the states' grand old regional\u00a0 party SAD to just 3 seats, while BJP won two, BSP 1 and one seat was won by an independent candidate.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAAP had declared Mann as it Chief minsiteral candidate\u00a0on January 19, barely a month before the elections.

life?","Narrative":"Everyone understands the need to protect the environment in daily life for a better future. This way we can pass on a healthier planet to the coming generations.\u00a0Green planet\u00a0and surroundings without pollution are a must. It is much needed for living a life without any diseases. Also, only a protected environment can provide us with the right resources and places for happy living.\n\nWe can protect our environment in several ways. Here are some points to help you out.\n\nRecycle and reuse\u00a0most of the things. Avoid throwing out reusable waste into the garbage; This will save the space of dumping waste into the lands and improve soil quality. The old things can be used to make new toys or jewellery. By thinking a little creatively, anyone can make wealth out of waste.\n\nPlastic bags\u00a0should be avoided\u00a0most of the time. Using reusable and washable bags must be in practice. Plastic bags take a lot of time to decompose; This will affect most animals\u2019 and fishes\u2019 lives when they accidentally eat plastic bags.\n\nIf several things cannot be reused, upcycling or recycling them is the best way. Know which items can be recycled and throw them in the bin accordingly. The recycling unit to which the garbage is carried will do the\u00a0work of recycling perfectly.\n\nPlastic bottles also cause harm to our health by releasing toxic chemicals into the drinking water after using the same bottle for a long time. Switching to steel or glass bottles will be a good idea.\n\nAnother way to keep the\u00a0environment pollution-free\u00a0is using cloth bags for any needs; This will be an alternative for single-use plastic bags. Cloth bags can be used for a long time, and further, they are degradable. Beverage consumption can also be done in reusable containers. One-use containers will only pollute the surroundings.\n\nHaving sustainable food for eating is one way to protect our environment. Smart seafood choices will help in saving the environment by causing no harm to the environment.\n\nWater is one of the essential resources. Using it mindfully and sensibly is a must. One can protect and\u00a0conserve the environment\u00a0by never wasting even a\u00a0single drop of water\u00a0with a conscience.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165443469984025.png","Account Created Date":"2021-04-05 15:33:22","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-04-05","Interest":"Environment, climate change, climate action, climate justice, protectearth, world environment day","Sports Events":null,"Associated Film Festivals":"Belmont World Film, Borderlines Film Festival, Istanbul International Film Festival, Hong Kong International Film Festival","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":982.11,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":293.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":54.110001,"New COVID Cases":96982.0,"New Deaths":446.0,"New Vaccinations":4005763.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"I Spent 50 Hours Buried Alive","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"MrBeast","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Views":60332012.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":3331049.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Everyone understands the need to protect the environment in daily life for a better future This way we can pass on a healthier planet to the coming generations Green planet and surroundings without pollution are a must It is much needed for living a life without any diseases Also only a protected environment can provide us with the right resources and places for happy living We can protect our environment in several ways Here are some points to help you out Recycle and reuse most of the things Avoid throwing out reusable waste into the garbage This will save the space of dumping waste into the lands and improve soil quality The old things can be used to make new toys or jewellery By thinking a little creatively anyone can make wealth out of waste Plastic bags should be avoided most of the time Using reusable and washable bags must be in practice Plastic bags take a lot of time to decompose This will affect most animals and fishes lives when they accidentally eat plastic bags If several things cannot be reused upcycling or recycling them is the best way Know which items can be recycled and throw them in the bin accordingly The recycling unit to which the garbage is carried will do the work of recycling perfectly Plastic bottles also cause harm to our health by releasing toxic chemicals into the drinking water after using the same bottle for a long time Switching to steel or glass bottles will be a good idea Another way to keep the environment pollution free is using cloth bags for any needs This will be an alternative for single use plastic bags Cloth bags can be used for a long time and further they are degradable Beverage consumption can also be done in reusable containers One use containers will only pollute the surroundings Having sustainable food for eating is one way to protect our environment Smart seafood choices will help in saving the environment by causing no harm to the environment Water is one of the essential resources Using it mindfully and sensibly is a must One can protect and conserve the environment by never wasting even a single drop of water with a conscience ","Translated Title":"How To Protect the Environment in our everyday life?","GeoTopic Name":"Tom Green County","GeoTopic Latitude":31.4044,"GeoTopic Longitude":-100.46207,"caption_generation":"a sign that says `` <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> '' .","object_recognition":"['jigsaw puzzle', 'swimming trunks, bathing trunks']","toxicity":0.0003314022,"severe_toxicity":0.0000013327,"obscene":0.0000283652,"identity_attack":0.0000616707,"insult":0.0000961058,"threat":0.0000161414,"sexual_explicit":0.0000127841},{"Dataset Index":93164,"Story Primary ID":149202,"Story ID":"STY1664175855","User Primary ID":104349,"User ID":"USR1664175419","Gender":null,"Age":21,"Title":"My cute sister","Narrative":"My cute sister ","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166417580839516.png","Account Created Date":"2022-09-26 12:26:59","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-09-26","Interest":"Technology, History, Food, Entertainment, Sports, Environment, Science, Inequality, Education, Health, Politics, Economy, Climate change ","Sports Events":"FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup, World Volleyball Championships (women)","Associated Film Festivals":"Zurich International Film Festival 2022, Nordisk Panorama 2022, Tirana Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_3","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1128.48,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":363.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":10.18,"New COVID Cases":3230.0,"New Deaths":32.0,"New Vaccinations":1039622.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"BLACKPINK -

In fact, if one approaches any urban house in India, one is most likely to see at least one teenager who is an avid K-pop fan and knows the nitty gritty of the K-pop industry,\u201d she asserted.\nRead more https:\/\/bestmediainfo.com\/2022\/10\/indepth-are-kpop-collaborations-really-going-to-be-the-next-big-thing-for-brands","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166572783120436.png","Account Created Date":"2021-02-15 16:20:15","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-02-15","Interest":"Technology, History, Food, Entertainment, Sports, Environment, Science, Inequality, Education, Health, Politics, Economy, Climate change ","Sports Events":"Six Nations, Australian Open, World Alpine Ski Championships","Associated Film Festivals":null,"Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":770.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":280.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":61.970001,"New COVID Cases":20770.0,"New Deaths":171.0,"New Vaccinations":464317.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"India claim stunning series win, end Australia's Gabba streak | Vodafone Test Series 2020-21","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"cricket.com.au","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Sports","YouTube Trending Video Views":37261157.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":806151.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"By Shreya Negi Korean popular aka K pop is a genre that has surged as the new black in the modern world and several brands have ended up having multiple collaborations with Korean artists Industry players have highlighted that K pop collaborations are not just a trend that brands are picking up but is here to stay for the long run Both Indian and international brands including food and beverage fashion and lifestyle sportswear and even automobile players had felt hopped onto the K pop bandwagon by collaborating with the artists to give their target audience an experiential involvement with the Korean culture K pop artists and bands like BTS Blackpink EXO Tri be etc have in the recent past joined forces with players like Coca Cola for Memu Agamu with Tri be and Armaan Malik McDonald s for BTS meal Samsung for BTS edition phones and Dynamite Hyundai for IONIQ launch Adidas Originals for FW Forum collection Fila for Love Yourself collection and Puma for Court Star and RS collection among other associations Adidas x Blackpink collaboration video According to Preeti Nayyar VP Brand Partnerships India and South Asia Universal Music Group for Brands Coca Cola as a brand globally looks at music and music based experiences as a way of communicating with youth Also GenZs in the age bracket of years are typically collaborators and early adopters which leads to them becoming a sweet spot for being influenced by brands owing to the habit formation factor India is the biggest market for YouTube and K pop as a genre sees the largest growing audience base coming from the country In fact if one approaches any urban house in India one is most likely to see at least one teenager who is an avid K pop fan and knows the nitty gritty of the K pop industry she asserted Read more ","Translated Title":"In-depth: Are K-Pop collaborations really going to be the next big thing for brands","GeoTopic Name":"British Indian Ocean Territory","GeoTopic Latitude":-6.0,"GeoTopic Longitude":72.0,"caption_generation":"a woman sitting in a chair holding a cell phone .","object_recognition":"['ice cream, icecream', 'candle, taper, wax light']","toxicity":0.00988021,"severe_toxicity":0.0000068792,"obscene":0.0007352908,"identity_attack":0.0003766743,"insult":0.0026586954,"threat":0.000169677,"sexual_explicit":0.0001923566},{"Dataset Index":41545,"Story Primary ID":80235,"Story ID":"STY1644392880","User Primary ID":27084,"User ID":"USR1644392706","Gender":null,"Age":27,"Title":"Climate change and workplace inequalities","Narrative":"Climate change disproportionately affects low income workers.

It allows the audience to envision falling in love with Humphrey Bogart or Ingrid Bergman. The characters sacrifice their love for the greater good of fighting against the Nazis.\n\nThe film, directed by Ingolstadt Bergman, was made on a tight budget and released with small expectations. In \"Casablanca,\" he plays Rick Blaine, the hard-drinking American running a nightclub in Casablanca. \n\nThe film tells the story of a German prisoner of war, Rick Steves, who moves easily in a corrupt world. The dialogue combines the cynical with the weary; wisecracks with epigrams. We see that Rick's love interest is Ilsa Lund (Bergman), the woman he loved years earlier in Paris. Now she is with Victor Laszlo (Henreid), a legendary hero of the French Resistance.\n\nThey are seen in close-up, and he adds, \"Ilsa, a dramatic musical chord marks their close-ups, and the action plays out in bitterness, sorrow, and the recollection of a love that was true.\" After a second watching, he continues, \"the more you see it, the more resonance the whole film gains.\"\n\nFilm combines suspense, romance and comedy as rarely brought together on the screen. None of the major characters is bad, some are cynical, some lie, some kill, but all are redeemed. Reviewer: \"If I were forced to choose between my country and my friend, I hope I would be brave enough to choose my friend\".\n\nFilmmaker Ingolstadt Bergman played the whole movie without knowing how it would end. The film is not so much brilliant as absolutely sound, rock-solid in its use of Hollywood studio craftsmanship. When this plot was remade in 1990 as \"Havana,\" the film suffered as a result\n\nPlaying like a favourite musical collection is \"Casablanca.\" Contrary to colour, black-and-white film has not aged as well. The dialogue is so terse and caustic that it hasn't become dated.

As a result, many individuals believe that the death sentence is the only just punishment for a willful murder. In general, criminal sanctions are tailored to the severity of the offences. That is why property offences, such as shoplifting, have low fines whereas personal crimes, such as kidnapping, have high sanctions.\n\nFamilies of victims are overwhelmingly in favour of capital punishment. Although not all victims' relatives accept the death penalty, many claim that the execution of the culprit provides closure and helps to ease some of their pain.\n\nMost aspects of the death sentence have changed in order to comply with the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. The crimes that are eligible for the death punishment have been narrowed significantly, and the selection procedure has been overhauled. Even the methods of execution have evolved over time. Hangings, gas chambers, firing squads, electric chairs, and deadly injections have all been utilised. It's worth noting that numerous jurisdictions have imposed a moratorium on executions while the efficacy of a new lethal injection formulation is studied. This should reassure people who believe the death sentence is inhumane or obsolete.\n\nRather of going to trial, up to 90% of all criminal cases are settled through plea bargaining. In most capital cases, perpetrators are offered life in prison in return for pleading guilty. This saves both the criminal and the prosecution money and time by avoiding a costly and time-consuming trial.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-16477249879796.png","Account Created Date":"2022-03-14 21:59:44","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-03-14","Interest":"death penalty, capital punishment","Sports Events":"Six Nations, ODI World Cup for women","Associated Film Festivals":"SXSW 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1062.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":332.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":28.0,"New COVID Cases":2568.0,"New Deaths":97.0,"New Vaccinations":1795410.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J.

They\u2019re racists and they\u2019re very sick, they\u2019re mentally sick,\u201d Trump said, before warning his audience: \u201cIn reality. They\u2019re not after me, they\u2019re after you.\u201d\n\nHe repeated his charge of racism, but skipped over an obvious detail: Those prosecutors are Black.\n\nHis diatribe left the clear impression that Trump, who rode the politics of white grievance into the White House, thinks he can\u2019t possibly be treated fairly by Black officials.\n\nThe comments carry the echoes of racist messages that have proliferated in recent years \u2013- that Black people and other minorities are taking power, and that they will exact revenge on white people, or at the very least treat white people as they have been treated.\n\nThat\u2019s among the fears stoking the white supremacy movement, the so-called \u201cwhite replacement theory\u201d that people of color will supplant whites in the country\u2019s power dynamics and social structure.\n\n\u201cThese are the same justifications that they use for Jim Crow laws and their mistreatment of African Americans. So this is just a rerun of what we\u2019ve seen in our country,\u201d said one Black district attorney, Brian Middleton of Fort Bend County, Texas, which lies southwest of central Houston.\n\nTrump attacking prosecutors is nothing new.

Loyal fans of Argentina\u2019s Lionel Messi, Portugal\u2019s Cristiano Ronaldo or Gareth Bale of Wales  are already excited; they all want their revered stars to end on high note \u2013 a memorable Qatar 2022 would add to the greatness they have already achieved.\n\nBut then, the list doesn\u2019t end with two or three footballers only. There are few others, who have reached legendary status in their own countries and will most probably lead their teams for the last time in Qatar. The first name that comes to mind is of Andres Guardado of Mexico, who has till date spent 17 glorious years with the national team. The 35-year-old came through the ranks of Mexican club Atlas, but he spent major part of his career in Spain, making 325 appearances combined for Deportivo La Coruna, Valencia, and Real Betis. The midfielder has made 175 appearances for Mexico, for who he has scored 28 goals. He made his Mexico debut in December 2005, just four months after his senior club debut. The Qatar meet is likely to be his last.\n\nCanada captain Atiba Hutchinson is another player, who is unlikely to be seen beyond the Qatar 2022. At 39, he can best be described as the old man of the squad. He will lead out a team with players like Alphonso Davies and Jonathan David, in the country\u2019s first World Cup since 1986. Hutchinson is a robust defensive midfielder who has played for Turkish club Besiktas since 2013. He is also the captain of the club. Hutchinson has made 265 appearances for the Turkish giants, scoring 23 goals. For Canada, he has made 97 appearances, scoring nine goals.

Both the clubs have a massive fanbase in West Bengal and when they come face to face in any tournament, the hype and buzz created about the match is insane. The cultural differences between the supporters of the two teams is the root cause of this rivalry and for over a hundred years, they have been arch enemies.\u00a0\n\nEast Bengal and Mohun Bagan will face each other in the 2022 Durand Cup as well and as expected, the fans are eagerly awaiting the match. The two sides will take on each other on 28th August at the Salt Lake Stadium, Sector 1, Kolkata.\u00a0\n\nThe online sale of tickets started on 6th August and not to our surprise, all the tickets were sold just within 30 minutes. It tells us a lot about the excitement and hype regarding this match. We need to consider the fact that one of the two teams, i.e Emami East Bengal, is currently going through a rough patch and the fact that their fans are still looking forward to this match is exemplary of the Bengali football tradition.\u00a0\n\nBut the problem of the hour is the lack of tickets as thousands of fans have complained about the unavailability of tickets. Listening to the plea of fans, the organisers have agreed to open two more slots of online ticket booking.\u00a0\n\nApart from that, the tickets will also be available at the Box office of Yuva Bharati Krirangan and the tents of these two clubs - East Bengal and Mohun Bagan.\u00a0\n\nOn the other hand, fans who have already bought their online tickets will also have to collect the hardcopy of their tickets from Mohammedan Sporting's tent in Maidan Kolkata.\u00a0\n\nImage Credits: bengaluruFC\/Twitter","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166097510520421.png","Account Created Date":"2022-07-14 13:13:33","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-07-14","Interest":"football, news, durandcup2022, tickets, offline","Sports Events":"Women's FIH Hockey World Cup, Tour de France, World Games, The Open Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"Melbourne Documentary Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_3","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1128.48,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":363.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":13.17,"New COVID Cases":20038.0,"New Deaths":47.0,"New Vaccinations":2929469.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"aespa \uc5d0\uc2a4\ud30c 'Girls' MV","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"SMTOWN","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Music","YouTube Trending Video Views":67440361.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1445780.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"We all know that the East Bengal vs Mohun Bagan derby is undoubtedly the biggest and one of the oldest rivalries in not only India but all over Asia Both the clubs have a massive fanbase in West Bengal and when they come face to face in any tournament the hype and buzz created about the match is insane The cultural differences between the supporters of the two teams is the root cause of this rivalry and for over a hundred years they have been arch enemies East Bengal and Mohun Bagan will face each other in the Durand Cup as well and as expected the fans are eagerly awaiting the match The two sides will take on each other on th August at the Salt Lake Stadium Sector Kolkata The online sale of tickets started on th August and not to our surprise all the tickets were sold just within minutes It tells us a lot about the excitement and hype regarding this match We need to consider the fact that one of the two teams i e Emami East Bengal is currently going through a rough patch and the fact that their fans are still looking forward to this match is exemplary of the Bengali football tradition But the problem of the hour is the lack of tickets as thousands of fans have complained about the unavailability of tickets Listening to the plea of fans the organisers have agreed to open two more slots of online ticket booking Apart from that the tickets will also be available at the Box office of Yuva Bharati Krirangan and the tents of these two clubs East Bengal and Mohun Bagan On the other hand fans who have already bought their online tickets will also have to collect the hardcopy of their tickets from Mohammedan Sporting s tent in Maidan Kolkata Image Credits bengaluruFC Twitter","Translated Title":"Durand Cup 2022: How to purchase tickets offline for East Bengal vs ATK Mohun Bagan match?","GeoTopic Name":null,"GeoTopic Latitude":null,"GeoTopic Longitude":null,"caption_generation":"a woman in a bikini riding a wave on a surfboard .","object_recognition":"['lab coat, laboratory coat', 'sunglass']","toxicity":0.01099421,"severe_toxicity":0.0000051263,"obscene":0.0000504323,"identity_attack":0.011591586,"insult":0.0010797612,"threat":0.000123665,"sexual_explicit":0.00002585},{"Dataset Index":6957,"Story Primary ID":107872,"Story ID":"STY1655458557","User Primary ID":6535,"User ID":"USR1622465874","Gender":"others","Age":13,"Title":"Pawan Hans Sale: Cayman firm\u2019s owners\u2019 claims don\u2019t add up","Narrative":"By Ravi Nair with Abir Dasgupta, Paranjoy Guha Thakurta\n\nOn 6 June, The Probe published an\u00a0interview\u00a0by these reporters with Amardeep Sharma, former Managing Director of Almas Global Opportunity Fund (AGOF), a Cayman Islands-registered entity. While Sharma claimed that everything about the \u201cwinning\u201d bid by Star9 Mobility Solutions Private Limited \u2013 of which AGOF is an important part \u2013 to acquire a majority stake in the public sector undertaking Pawan Hans Limited (formerly Helicopter Corporation of India) is above board, several doubts and unanswered questions remain.\n\nOn 29 April, Star9 Mobility was\u00a0declared\u00a0the winning bidder for the government-owned helicopter service provider. AGOF holds the largest (49%) stake in Star9 Mobility that has bid Rs 211 crore for the Indian government\u2019s 51% stake in Pawan Hans.\n\nOn 16 May, these reporters published an article in The Wire and NewsClick\u00a0investigating\u00a0the antecedents of the Star9 Mobility consortium, pointing out that there were questions about whether AGOF met the eligibility criteria laid out by the government to participate in the bidding and that an adverse order had been passed against it by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) a week before Star9 Mobility\u2019s selection as the winning bidder. On the same day, it was\u00a0reported\u00a0that the privatisation of Pawan Hans had been \u201cput on hold.\u201d\n\nOn 28 May, we wrote in The Probe a second article\u00a0delving deeper\u00a0into the antecedents of AGOF wherein we detailed the links between AGOF and Kudakwashe Reginald Tagwirei, a controversial businessman from Zimbabwe. Our report described how AGOF had allegedly acted as a front for Tagwirei to channel his funds and that the fund had continued its association with him even after he was sanctioned by the governments of the United States of America and the United Kingdom. The article further pointed out that two government documents suggested that allowing the sale of Pawan Hans to Star9 Mobility would constitute a violation of government rules \u2013 due to the adverse order by the NCLT against AGOF and due to the fund appearing to not have met the eligibility criteria to bid for the shares of the government company.\n\nRead the full story here:- https:\/\/theprobe.in\/pawan-hans-sale-cayman-firms-owners-claims-dont-add-up\/","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165545848641445.png","Account Created Date":"2021-05-31 18:27:54","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-05-31","Interest":"the probe","Sports Events":"IIHF World Championship, French Open","Associated Film Festivals":"Istanbul International Film Festival, Cheltenham International Film Festival, Inside Out Toronto LGBT Film Festival, Molodist Kyiv International Film Festival, Krakow Film Festival","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":982.11,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":293.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":62.119999,"New COVID Cases":127510.0,"New Deaths":2795.0,"New Vaccinations":1784772.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"EVERGLOW (\uc5d0\ubc84\uae00\ub85c\uc6b0) - FIRST MV","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Stone Music Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Music","YouTube Trending Video Views":47967723.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":740701.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"By Ravi Nair with Abir Dasgupta Paranjoy Guha Thakurta On June The Probe published an interview by these reporters with Amardeep Sharma former Managing Director of Almas Global Opportunity Fund AGOF a Cayman Islands registered entity While Sharma claimed that everything about the winning bid by Star Mobility Solutions Private Limited of which AGOF is an important part to acquire a majority stake in the public sector undertaking Pawan Hans Limited formerly Helicopter Corporation of India is above board several doubts and unanswered questions remain On April Star Mobility was declared the winning bidder for the government owned helicopter service provider AGOF holds the largest stake in Star Mobility that has bid Rs crore for the Indian government s stake in Pawan Hans On May these reporters published an article in The Wire and NewsClick investigating the antecedents of the Star Mobility consortium pointing out that there were questions about whether AGOF met the eligibility criteria laid out by the government to participate in the bidding and that an adverse order had been passed against it by the National Company Law Tribunal NCLT a week before Star Mobility s selection as the winning bidder On the same day it was reported that the privatisation of Pawan Hans had been put on hold On May we wrote in The Probe a second article delving deeper into the antecedents of AGOF wherein we detailed the links between AGOF and Kudakwashe Reginald Tagwirei a controversial businessman from Zimbabwe Our report described how AGOF had allegedly acted as a front for Tagwirei to channel his funds and that the fund had continued its association with him even after he was sanctioned by the governments of the United States of America and the United Kingdom The article further pointed out that two government documents suggested that allowing the sale of Pawan Hans to Star Mobility would constitute a violation of government rules due to the adverse order by the NCLT against AGOF and due to the fund appearing to not have met the eligibility criteria to bid for the shares of the government company Read the full story here ","Translated Title":"Pawan Hans Sale: Cayman firm\u2019s owners\u2019 claims don\u2019t add up","GeoTopic Name":"Cayman Islands","GeoTopic Latitude":19.5,"GeoTopic Longitude":-80.66667,"caption_generation":"a large mountain range with mountains in the background .","object_recognition":"['military uniform', 'bearskin, busby, shako']","toxicity":0.0017235358,"severe_toxicity":0.000002106,"obscene":0.0000630212,"identity_attack":0.000158844,"insult":0.000326688,"threat":0.0001279133,"sexual_explicit":0.0000244746},{"Dataset Index":44806,"Story Primary ID":97936,"Story ID":"STY1651453778","User Primary ID":28648,"User ID":"USR1646134328","Gender":null,"Age":12,"Title":"5.

If it suits the individuals, it bestows all pleasures related to the 4th house. Those individuals who have the moon in the ascendant, 2nd, 4th, 5th and 9th houses can go ahead and wear a natural Pearl gem stone. \n\nPearl for Taurus ascendant \n\nPearl gemstone should be avoided in the Taurus ascendant unless Moon is placed in the ascendant itself and the individual is running the major period of the Moon. Generally it is seen that in this case, Moon gives problems such as asthma and common cold quite frequently but good improvements are seen upon wearing a pearl. \n\nPearl for Gemini ascendant \n\nMoon owns the second house of wealth. Pearl gemstone should be worn if Moon is placed in the 2nd house in its own sign or 10th house in Pisces only in the major period of the Moon after a proper astrological analysis of the horoscope. It is advised that if in Gemini Ascendant pearl is being recommended the individual should tie the pearl in a white cotton cloth on the right arm from an auspicious time calculated as per electional astrology and assess tolerance and suitability for a period of 14 days. \n\nPearl for Cancer ascendant \n\nIn Cancer ascendant Moon is the ascendant Lord and is very auspicious. Moon placed in the ascendant, 9th house, 10th house, 11th house, 7th house will make sure that Pearl gemstone suits the individual. In these positions \nMoon will bestow all comforts. However, those who have Moon placed in the 5th House in Scorpio should consider wearing pearl only in moon major period.

(Part-1)","Narrative":"Where should we start about Chelsea? Nothing has gone right for the London outfit since the start of the new season. The club could not sign the right players at the right amount at the start of the transfer window. The club\u2019s new owner, Todd Boehly, and former manager, ThomasTuchel were not on the same page and that resulted in the sacking of the latter. Chelsea has appointed Graham Potter as their new gaffer for the 2022\/23 season.\nChelsea started their English Premier League campaign with a win but it could not sustain the pressure of the league and started to crumble. However, they kept themselves in the first half of the points table with wins, losses, and draws. However, Chelsea is yet to kickstart their Champions League campaign as they have a loss and a draw to their name in the first two games of the continental showdown.\nIn this piece, we shall look at the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of Chelsea for the 2022\/23 season:\nStrengths:\nChelsea's strength lies in their defense. Though it has shipped the goals at the start of the season, the depth in their defense can help them to bail out of the station. The talented wing-backs have provided the impetus to the attack and remain the core strength of the team.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The addition of the likes of Pierre Emerick Aubameyang and Raheem Sterling can be pivotal in their fortunes going forward.\nWeakness:\nThe weakness of the London-based outfit is their attack. Though they have forwards and attacking midfielders, the club lacks a finisher. Chelsea did not sign any forwards after the departure of both Timo Werner and Romelu Lukaku. Though Romelu Lukaku has left the club on loan, the management failed to invest in the attack which has cost them multiple games. If the poor form of their forwards continues, Chelsea might struggle to finish in the top-four in the 2022\/23 season.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166365971869608.png","Account Created Date":"2022-09-05 15:01:39","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-09-05","Interest":"premierleague, chelsea, swot, strength, weakness","Sports Events":"World Volleyball Championships (men), US Open","Associated Film Festivals":"Venice International Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_3","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1128.48,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":363.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":11.22,"New COVID Cases":4417.0,"New Deaths":23.0,"New Vaccinations":2925199.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"BLACKPINK - \u2018Pink Venom\u2019 M\/V","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"BLACKPINK","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Music","YouTube Trending Video Views":255524865.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":12715882.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Where should we start about Chelsea Nothing has gone right for the London outfit since the start of the new season The club could not sign the right players at the right amount at the start of the transfer window The club s new owner Todd Boehly and former manager ThomasTuchel were not on the same page and that resulted in the sacking of the latter Chelsea has appointed Graham Potter as their new gaffer for the season Chelsea started their English Premier League campaign with a win but it could not sustain the pressure of the league and started to crumble However they kept themselves in the first half of the points table with wins losses and draws However Chelsea is yet to kickstart their Champions League campaign as they have a loss and a draw to their name in the first two games of the continental showdown In this piece we shall look at the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats of Chelsea for the season Strengths Chelsea s strength lies in their defense Though it has shipped the goals at the start of the season the depth in their defense can help them to bail out of the station The talented wing backs have provided the impetus to the attack and remain the core strength of the team nbsp nbsp nbsp The addition of the likes of Pierre Emerick Aubameyang and Raheem Sterling can be pivotal in their fortunes going forward Weakness The weakness of the London based outfit is their attack Though they have forwards and attacking midfielders the club lacks a finisher Chelsea did not sign any forwards after the departure of both Timo Werner and Romelu Lukaku Though Romelu Lukaku has left the club on loan the management failed to invest in the attack which has cost them multiple games If the poor form of their forwards continues Chelsea might struggle to finish in the top four in the season ","Translated Title":"Premier League 2022\/23: Chelsea SWOT Analysis (Part-1)","GeoTopic Name":"London","GeoTopic Latitude":51.49227,"GeoTopic Longitude":-0.30864,"caption_generation":"a person holding a pair of scissors in their hands .","object_recognition":"['comic book', 'volcano']","toxicity":0.0006037226,"severe_toxicity":0.0000014975,"obscene":0.0000326733,"identity_attack":0.0000857536,"insult":0.0001285028,"threat":0.0000307657,"sexual_explicit":0.0000186408},{"Dataset Index":11058,"Story Primary ID":122148,"Story ID":"STY1659682677","User Primary ID":9109,"User ID":"USR1632472672","Gender":"others","Age":23,"Title":"As India Gets First Adivasi President, Plan To Boost Tribal Healthcare Has Been Ignored....","Narrative":"On 21 July 2022, India chose its first tribal President, representing more than 110 million of its most disadvantaged community.\n\n\nFormer Jharkhand governor Droupadi Murmu sailed through presidential elections, creating history, as she defeated the opposition candidate and former union finance minister Yashwant Sinha, in being elected India\u2019s 15th president since 1950. \n\n\nMurmu\u2019s victory was significant, as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), looks to consolidate its political grip on tribal India by riding on the political symbolism of anointing a tribal woman leader as the head of the republic. \n\n\nMurmu is a Santhal from Odisha, home to 9.5 million tribals. The move to nominate a tribal woman for the presidential election also split the opposition and forced some parties of the opposition United Progressive Alliance (UPA) to vote for her.\n\n\nIt was difficult for most parties to go against a tribal candidate when India\u2019s Adivasis are scattered over a fifth of districts, or 150 of 773, and influence electoral outcomes in several parliamentary constituencies: 47 of 543 Parliamentary seats are reserved for scheduled tribes (STs), and 151 districts have an ST population of at least 25%, enough to affect electoral outcomes.\n\n\nYet, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken no action on a key report submitted five years ago by what remains the only post-independence expert inquiring into the status of tribal health and healthcare. \n\n\nIndeed, some government agencies, often, did not cooperate with the committee, said its head, Abhay Bang, MD (medicine), PhD, 72, a practising doctor and founder and head of the nonprofit Society for Education, Action and Research in Community Health (SEARCH). He and his wife Rani, a gynaecologist, have been providing medical services to Adivasis since the late 1980s.\n\n\n\u201cFrankly, the tribals probably don\u2019t count politically, and we don\u2019t count them,\u201d Bang told Article 14. \u201cNational priorities don\u2019t count tribals. The health system does not count what happens to the tribal health. \n\n\nRead more - https:\/\/article-14.com\/post\/as-india-gets-first-adivasi-president-plan-to-boost-tribal-healthcare-has-been-ignored-for-5-years-62ec7f095b126","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165968252769420.png","Account Created Date":"2021-09-24 14:07:52","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-09-24","Interest":"#article14live","Sports Events":"UCI Road World Championships, Ryder Cup","Associated Film Festivals":"Helsinki International Film Festival, San Sebastian Film Festival, Haifa International Film Festival, Zurich Film Festival","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_3","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1067.47,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":306.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":83.110001,"New COVID Cases":29616.0,"New Deaths":290.0,"New Vaccinations":10413980.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Lil Nas X -

He proposed that the occupation of Tibet should also take place by sending a column from Xinjiang, through the uninhabited Aksai Chin plateau, to Ngari in western Tibet, in addition to an advance from the traditional Sino-Tibetan borderlands in China\u2019s Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. Deng and the military commander of the 2nd Field Army, the one-eyed veteran Gen. Liu Bocheng had long been comrades as leaders in the 128th Division, the PLA\u2019s elite formation in the war against the Japanese. The 128th Division had grown to become the 2nd Field Army in the war against the Nationalist Army of Chiang Kai-shek, and the partnership between the old campaigners had always been very successful. \n\nOn January 1, 1950, the PRC broadcast a communiqu\u00e9 stating that the task for the PLA for 1950 is to liberate Taiwan, Hainan and Tibet. On January 2, 1950, Mao gave Deng permission to attack Tibet. All responsibility was left to Deng. \n\nOn Jan 10, 1950, Mao sent another telegram to the 2nd Field Army ordering that the preparation for the liberation of Tibet should be accelerated. It took the 18th Corps of the 2nd Field Army eight months to get ready to advance into Tibet and fight the barely trained and poorly motivated Tibetan army. One of Deng\u2019s qualities was that he knew everything about his enemies; he certainly knew that Tibet was militarily weak, and its policies not fully united.

It creates a deeply personal connection between our sporting figures and the nation they represent on a global stage.However, as scholars and athletes have recently contended with the fraught legacy of the trophy\u2019s namesake, the Lou Marsh Award has itself become a ponderous weight for those who receive it.Although the athlete-centered award is intended to be one of the highest honours that can be given, cutting across gender or sporting distinctions, these recipients have accepted it under the shadow of Marsh\u2019s legacy.In February 2021, Janice Forsyth, professor of Indigenous Land-Based Physical Culture and Wellness at the University of British Columbia, wrote a piece about the implications of the award being named in Marsh\u2019s honour and \u201cwhat it is like to win a sport award named after a notorious racist.\u201dRead more: https:\/\/theconversation.com\/the-toronto-star-is-making-the-right-move-by-renaming-the-lou-marsh-trophy-191831","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166512516263650.jpeg","Account Created Date":"2022-04-20 11:35:32","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-04-20","Interest":"Technology, History, Food, Entertainment, Sports, Environment, Science, Inequality, Education, Health, Politics, Economy, Climate change ","Sports Events":"Invictus Games, World Snooker Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"Pan African Film & Arts Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":30.76,"New COVID Cases":2380.0,"New Deaths":56.0,"New Vaccinations":744947.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Watch the uncensored moment Will Smith smacks Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, drops F-bomb","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Guardian News","YouTube Trending Video Category":"News & Politics","YouTube Trending Video Views":97122193.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1427129.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"The Toronto Star recently announced it will be changing the name of the Lou Marsh Award effective this year Since the award named after athlete and sports journalist Lou Marsh has been given annually to Canada s top athlete of the year based on a vote by journalists across the country During a summer spent working at Canada s Sports Hall of Fame I frequently passed by the Lou Marsh Trophy one of the most prestigious awards in Canadian sport The trophy itself a centimetre solid marble trophy is a fitting representation of the award s place in Canadian society Unlike the small cup that is given to each recipient of the Lou Marsh Award the actual trophy is a massive structure that cannot be physically lifted by any one person While working at the Hall I heard stories about the monument repeatedly cracking the foundation on which it rested As it turned out no foundation could adequately support such a heavy load A piece of Canadian historyThe Lou Marsh Award occupies a special place in Canadian sport and sport history It creates a deeply personal connection between our sporting figures and the nation they represent on a global stage However as scholars and athletes have recently contended with the fraught legacy of the trophy s namesake the Lou Marsh Award has itself become a ponderous weight for those who receive it Although the athlete centered award is intended to be one of the highest honours that can be given cutting across gender or sporting distinctions these recipients have accepted it under the shadow of Marsh s legacy In February Janice Forsyth professor of Indigenous Land Based Physical Culture and Wellness at the University of British Columbia wrote a piece about the implications of the award being named in Marsh s honour and what it is like to win a sport award named after a notorious racist Read more ","Translated Title":"The Toronto Star is making the right move by renaming the Lou Marsh trophy","GeoTopic Name":"Canada","GeoTopic Latitude":60.10867,"GeoTopic Longitude":-113.64258,"caption_generation":"a man wearing a hat and a baseball cap .","object_recognition":"['streetcar, tram, tramcar, trolley, trolley car', 'prison, prison house']","toxicity":0.000744536,"severe_toxicity":0.0000041395,"obscene":0.0000801095,"identity_attack":0.0001681546,"insult":0.0002336466,"threat":0.0000225285,"sexual_explicit":0.0000314443},{"Dataset Index":54336,"Story Primary ID":103502,"Story ID":"STY1653897734","User Primary ID":32675,"User ID":"USR1650434732","Gender":null,"Age":21,"Title":"If you cry while watching movies, it is probably a sign of your emotional\u00a0strength","Narrative":"You have probably found yourself weeping quietly, or even suddenly sobbing uncontrollably, while watching a movie. Common culprits include Marley and Me, The Color Purple, Schindler\u2019s List and The Lion King.\n\nYou may have tried to blubber discretely so your dry-eyed companions didn\u2019t think you were a sook (and no doubt you had a sneaky look sideways to see if they were glassy-eyed too), or you may have boldly sobbed away.\n\nWhy do we cry in movies? Is this a sign of emotional weakness (hence hiding it from your friends) or an indicator of strength \u2013 evidence of emotional intelligence?\n\nGood movies are carefully crafted to engage us and be deeply absorbing. They transport us into the world of their characters: to see as they see, feel as they feel, and even totally identify with a character in some cases. We know movies are not real, but we are so engrossed that we emotionally react as though they are.\n\nSome are based on true stories, and knowing this makes them even more potent. The emotional power of some movies is especially captivating: they\u2019re not called tearjerkers for nothing.\n\nThe love hormone\nNeuroscientist Paul Zak has studied the effects of compelling stories, showing watching them can cause the release of oxytocin.\n\nOxytocin is best known for its role in childbirth and breast feeding, increasing contractions during labour and stimulating the milk ducts. It is also released in response to positive physical contact \u2013 hugging, kissing, sexual intimacy and even petting animals \u2013 as well as through positive social interactions.\n\nConsequently, it has been called the \u201clove hormone\u201d.\nAs social animals, our survival depends on social bonding, and oxytocin is critical. It helps us to identify and attach with our essential caregivers and protective social groups.\n\nRead more - https:\/\/theconversation.com\/if-you-cry-while-watching-movies-it-is-probably-a-sign-of-your-emotional-strength-182664","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165389761277263.png","Account Created Date":"2022-04-20 11:35:32","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-04-20","Interest":"the conversation, australia","Sports Events":"Invictus Games, World Snooker Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"Pan African Film & Arts Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":30.76,"New COVID Cases":2380.0,"New Deaths":56.0,"New Vaccinations":744947.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Watch the uncensored moment Will Smith smacks Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, drops F-bomb","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Guardian News","YouTube Trending Video Category":"News & Politics","YouTube Trending Video Views":97122193.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1427129.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"You have probably found yourself weeping quietly or even suddenly sobbing uncontrollably while watching a movie Common culprits include Marley and Me The Color Purple Schindler s List and The Lion King You may have tried to blubber discretely so your dry eyed companions didn t think you were a sook and no doubt you had a sneaky look sideways to see if they were glassy eyed too or you may have boldly sobbed away Why do we cry in movies Is this a sign of emotional weakness hence hiding it from your friends or an indicator of strength evidence of emotional intelligence Good movies are carefully crafted to engage us and be deeply absorbing They transport us into the world of their characters to see as they see feel as they feel and even totally identify with a character in some cases We know movies are not real but we are so engrossed that we emotionally react as though they are Some are based on true stories and knowing this makes them even more potent The emotional power of some movies is especially captivating they re not called tearjerkers for nothing The love hormone Neuroscientist Paul Zak has studied the effects of compelling stories showing watching them can cause the release of oxytocin Oxytocin is best known for its role in childbirth and breast feeding increasing contractions during labour and stimulating the milk ducts It is also released in response to positive physical contact hugging kissing sexual intimacy and even petting animals as well as through positive social interactions Consequently it has been called the love hormone As social animals our survival depends on social bonding and oxytocin is critical It helps us to identify and attach with our essential caregivers and protective social groups Read more ","Translated Title":"If you cry while watching movies, it is probably a sign of your emotional\u00a0strength","GeoTopic Name":null,"GeoTopic Latitude":null,"GeoTopic Longitude":null,"caption_generation":"a group of young men playing a game of frisbee .","object_recognition":"[\"pajama, pyjama, pj's, jammies\"]","toxicity":0.0069992566,"severe_toxicity":0.000132498,"obscene":0.0004753388,"identity_attack":0.0009459191,"insult":0.0020980542,"threat":0.0007708686,"sexual_explicit":0.0002222135},{"Dataset Index":27588,"Story Primary ID":129172,"Story ID":"STY1660860035","User Primary ID":20802,"User ID":"USR1642092657","Gender":"male","Age":33,"Title":"Calcio: la Fiorentina batte 2-1 il Twente in Conference League","Narrative":"L\u2019insolita settimana di Ferragosto del calcio \u00e8 anche competizioni europee.

Giorginio Wijnaldum insists he is happy with life at Paris Saint-Germain as the former Liverpool star clarified comments in an earlier interview.\n\nIn October, with playing time hard to come by, the Dutch midfielder said\u00a0he was not \"completely happy\" at the club after a \"very difficult\" start to life in France.\n\nAt the time, Wijnaldum had yet to register a goal or assist in 11 appearances but, having adjusted to his new club, the ex-Liverpool star says his complaints were down to his lack of playing time, not the club itself.\n\nWhat was said?\n\n\"The fact is, when I had this interview, I was just a little disappointed with the way things were going on the field at the start of the season on a personal level,\" he told PSG's magazine.\n\n\"In this period, many thought that I was not happy at the club when I was. I was just not happy with the playing time that I had at that time.\n\n\"A journalist asked me: 'Are you satisfied with your playing time?' Well, no, I wasn't. I think any player who spends more time sitting on a bench than on the pitch won't be fulfilled by that.\n\n\"So, yeah, that's how I answered this question, but the media interpreted my words by saying that I was not happy at PSG.\"\n\nHaving joined PSG on a free transfer, Wijnaldum did have initial struggles during his first few months in Paris.\n\nWIjnaldum has now made 27 appearances, scoring three times, with two of those coming against RB Leipzig in a Champions League clash in November.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-164564549797484.png","Account Created Date":"2021-11-20 04:34:28","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-11-20","Interest":"football, psg","Sports Events":null,"Associated Film Festivals":"French Film Festival, European Film Forum SCANORAMA, Cork International Film Festival, Made In Prague Festival, Stockholm International Film Festival, Norwich Film Festival, Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, International Documentary Festival Amsterdam, Cambridge Film Festival, Bali International Film Festival (Balinale)","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_4","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1297.89,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":319.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":51.32,"New COVID Cases":10488.0,"New Deaths":313.0,"New Vaccinations":10089449.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"How could I get out of it?

Here are my top three Positives from their American preseason.\n\n#1 Jesus is already the Gunners' guardian angel\n\nWe were all aware that Arsenal wanted a fresh number nine starting in January. A very good one at that. Mikel Arteta and Edu criticized the signing of Gabriel Jesus and how successful he has been thus far.The 25-year-old came out of the gate strong and destroyed teams in the process. He scored twice against FC Nurnberg, which was unusual, and then scored again against Everton.\n\nJesus was once again outspoken about Chelsea performing that particular action. He had a stunning ability to take a pass from deep, turn his opponent, and then throw the ball to Gabriel Martinelli, Bukayo Saka, or Martin Odegaard.The Blues' backline was unable to contain him because of his incredible speed, agility, and football IQ.Arsenal is entering the league season with a number nine who will terrorize any defenses in the league.\n\u00a0\n(Image credits: Twitter\/Arsenal FC)","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166057557083160.png","Account Created Date":"2022-03-01 19:51:35","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-03-01","Interest":"football, arsenal, everton, mattturner, fabiovieira","Sports Events":"Six Nations","Associated Film Festivals":null,"Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1062.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":332.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":37.84,"New COVID Cases":7554.0,"New Deaths":223.0,"New Vaccinations":1495732.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J.

Ancora una volta \u00e8 stato costretto a ritirarsi a causa di un infortunio, questa volta agli ottavi di finale del Roland Garros contro Rublev. Lo stop \u00e8 arrivato al terzo set quando il risultato era di 1-1 (1-6 6-3) e un parziale di 2 giochi a 0 per il tennista russo. \n\nUn vero peccato perch\u00e9 l'altoatesino stava giocando un buon tennis, nonostante il 6-1 del primo set. Nel secondo, vinto proprio da Sinner, ha iniziato ad accusare dolore al ginocchio sinistro. Colpa dell'infiammazione al tendine rotuleo che \u00e8 tornata a far male. Non si \u00e8 fermato subito, ha continuato, ha vinto il secondo set 6-4 ma poi \u00e8 crollato nel terzo arrendendosi.\n\n\"Mi dispiace perch\u00e9 ho giocato molto bene il primo set. Tennisticamente sto migliorando. Sto servendo meglio. Fisicamente sono cresciuto fino alla fine dello scorso anno. Se ci sar\u00e0 bisogno di fermarsi per 2, 3 tornei, lo far\u00f2. Non voglio giocare col dolore\", le parole di Sinner dopo il match perso.\n\nAll'inizio si diceva che il 2022 per Sinner \u00e8 stato caratterizzato dagli infortuni. Cinque da inizio anno: il primo a Indian Weels al quarto turno contro Kyrgios in cui l'italiano si \u00e8 ritirato a causa dell'influenza. A Miami a fermarlo contro Cerundolo sono state le vesciche al piede. Problema agli addominali al Monte Carlo Master al primo turno contro Coric. Ancora agli Internazionali d'Italia quando ha dovuto abbandonare il match contro Tsisipas per un fastidio all'anca. Ora anche il Roland Garros.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165400974045716.jpeg","Account Created Date":"2021-11-26 15:41:02","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-11-26","Interest":"sinner, roland garros","Sports Events":"World Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"French Film Festival, Made In Prague Festival, Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, International Documentary Festival Amsterdam","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_4","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1297.89,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":319.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":49.759998,"New COVID Cases":8318.0,"New Deaths":465.0,"New Vaccinations":12229439.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"$456,000 Squid Game In Real Life!","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"MrBeast","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Views":55419453.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":6284727.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"it","Title TikaDetect":"it","Narrative LangDetect":"it","Title LangDetect":"it","Translated Narrative":"A complicated year for Sinner Once again he was forced to retire due to an injury this time in the round of 16 of Roland Garros against Rublev The stop came in the third set when the result was and a partial of games for the Russian tennis player A real shame because the South Tyrolean was playing good tennis despite the first set In the second won by Sinner he began to experience pain in his left knee It was the inflammation of the patellar tendon that hurt again He didn&#39;t stop immediately he continued he won the second set but then collapsed in the third giving up I&#39;m sorry because I played the first set very well Tennis-wise I&#39;m improving I&#39;m serving better Physically I&#39;ve grown up until the end of last year If I need to stop for tournaments I&#39;ll do it I don&#39;t want to play words with pain of Sinner after the lost match At the beginning it was said that Sinner was characterized by injuries Five since the beginning of the year the first in Indian Weels in the fourth round against Kyrgios in which the Italian withdrew due to the flu In Miami to stop him against Cerundolo were blisters on the foot Abdominal problem at the Monte Carlo Master in the first round against Coric Again at the Internazionali d Italia when he had to abandon the match against Tsisipas due to a hip discomfort Now also Roland Garros","Translated Title":"Sinner e gli infortuni nel 2022: il Roland Garros \u00e8 il quinto ritiro","GeoTopic Name":"Miami County","GeoTopic Latitude":40.7695,"GeoTopic Longitude":-86.04502,"caption_generation":"a cat laying on top of a stuffed animal .","object_recognition":"['maypole']","toxicity":0.0004343519,"severe_toxicity":0.0000013039,"obscene":0.0000268108,"identity_attack":0.0000796279,"insult":0.0001122744,"threat":0.0000206483,"sexual_explicit":0.0000132422},{"Dataset Index":24832,"Story Primary ID":79063,"Story ID":"STY1643890753","User Primary ID":14196,"User ID":"USR1640612333","Gender":"male","Age":24,"Title":"Uruguay grabs an important win against Venezuela","Narrative":"Uruguay faced Venezuela for the 16th match of the CONMEBOL World Cup Qualification. Uruguay needed to get all three points to keep their World Cup dream alive. There are four confirmed spots on the table. Argentina and Brazil have already grabbed 2 places. The last two spots are still left for grab.\n\n\n Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay and Chile are looking at the contenders for the spots remaining. Uruguay was struggling to win matches a few weeks back.However, they won both matches in 2022. This helped Uruguay to climb up to the 4th position of the table. \n\n\nUruguay went with a 4-4-2 formation. Cavani , Suarez, Valverde and Bentancur started the attack for te game. Venezuela is at the bottom of the table. They are not gonna qualify for the World Cup this season. They have won just 1 game in the last 5 fixtures. \n\n\nThe match went out from Venezuela sight when they conceded in the very first minute of the game. Betancur owned the scoring. From that point, Uruguay had the confidence to go and attack in the game. They had 22 shots in the game. Venezuela was way behind with just 9 shots in the whole game. Georgian De Arrascaeta scored the second goal in 23 minutes. \n\n\nUruguay didn't stop at 2 goals in the first half. Cavani made it 3-0 at the extra time with a wonderful bicycle kick. The game was in Uruguay hands after the first half. In the second half, Suarez scored the 4th goal for Uruguay. Venezuela was able to get a consolation goal which ended the match with a scoreline of 4-1.\n\n\nUruguay is on fire this season. They move to the 4th position with 22 points from 16 games. Venezuela is at the bottom of the table with 10 points from 16 games. \n\n\nUruguay will next meet Peru in March for one of the deciding games. Peru is in 5th position with 21 points. The winner of the game will clearly have one foot in the 2022 world cup. Venezuela will face Argentina who is in great form.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-164389055035046.png","Account Created Date":"2021-12-27 19:08:53","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-12-27","Interest":"football, football tactics, football fields, football \u26bd\ufe0f, world cup, qualification, uruguay, argentina","Sports Events":null,"Associated Film Festivals":null,"Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_4","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1297.89,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":319.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":48.639999,"New COVID Cases":6358.0,"New Deaths":293.0,"New Vaccinations":3715516.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Crazy #alluarjun #painting  #shorts #viral #trending","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Dr.Harrsha Artist","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Film & Animation","YouTube Trending Video Views":85050565.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":5587264.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"br","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Uruguay faced Venezuela for the th match of the CONMEBOL World Cup Qualification Uruguay needed to get all three points to keep their World Cup dream alive There are four confirmed spots on the table Argentina and Brazil have already grabbed places The last two spots are still left for grab Ecuador Peru Uruguay and Chile are looking at the contenders for the spots remaining Uruguay was struggling to win matches a few weeks back However they won both matches in This helped Uruguay to climb up to the th position of the table Uruguay went with a formation Cavani Suarez Valverde and Bentancur started the attack for te game Venezuela is at the bottom of the table They are not gonna qualify for the World Cup this season They have won just game in the last fixtures The match went out from Venezuela sight when they conceded in the very first minute of the game Betancur owned the scoring From that point Uruguay had the confidence to go and attack in the game They had shots in the game Venezuela was way behind with just shots in the whole game Georgian De Arrascaeta scored the second goal in minutes Uruguay didn t stop at goals in the first half Cavani made it at the extra time with a wonderful bicycle kick The game was in Uruguay hands after the first half In the second half Suarez scored the th goal for Uruguay Venezuela was able to get a consolation goal which ended the match with a scoreline of Uruguay is on fire this season They move to the th position with points from games Venezuela is at the bottom of the table with points from games Uruguay will next meet Peru in March for one of the deciding games Peru is in th position with points The winner of the game will clearly have one foot in the world cup Venezuela will face Argentina who is in great form ","Translated Title":"Uruguay grabs an important win against Venezuela","GeoTopic Name":"Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela","GeoTopic Latitude":8.0,"GeoTopic Longitude":-66.0,"caption_generation":"a bunch of flowers that are in a vase .","object_recognition":"['soccer ball']","toxicity":0.0004101188,"severe_toxicity":0.000001442,"obscene":0.0000286953,"identity_attack":0.0000870539,"insult":0.0001024184,"threat":0.0000192996,"sexual_explicit":0.0000120512},{"Dataset Index":57842,"Story Primary ID":98377,"Story ID":"STY1651670187","User Primary ID":33892,"User ID":"USR1650981290","Gender":null,"Age":19,"Title":"What I've been currently reading: Dream Psychology by Sigmund Freud","Narrative":"With a close friend studying psychology, I stumbled upon this title and got immediately intrigued to inspect its contents. Sigmund Freud, an Austrian neurologist ,the founder of psychoanalysis, a method to evaluate and treat pathologies relating to the psyche through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst(now more commonly known as a psychologist or a psychiatrist), is renowned for his notable theories regarding cocaine, the unconscious psychosexual development, the id, ego and super-ego, life and death drives, melancholia, religion and dreams. He has written many works elaborating on all his theories on these topics, one such being the book called \"Dream Psychology\". This book explains Freud's belief that dreams are a representation of our repressed desires and longings, that they are unconscious thoughts of wish fulfillment and motivations. He states that dreams show our most beloved and anxious desires in our unconscious so that we remain motivated while awake to strive and work towards achieving these dreams, of whatever sort they may be. This book was published in 1920 and can be seen as a sort of sequel to his previous publishing in 1899, \"The Interpretation of Dreams\", which was the original classic relaying Freud's major ideas and psychology principles. That book emphasizes the role of the unconscious and psychoanalysis of dreams as they are highly symbolic having both manifest and latent content. \"Dream Psychology\" on the other hand, relays that unfulfilled past or present conflicts prop up as dreams, about the unruliness of the unconscious as dreams due to the censor of the preconscious, and their overall mechanism of how dreams are shown and how they should be seen, their interpretation. It is a very fulfilling read, lending some clarity into and about the weird and incredibly complex state and mechanism of the human psychology.\n\n\n\n\n\nImages Source: Apple

Benfica is seeking roughly \u20ac75 million (\u00a363 million) for the Uruguayan.\n\nThe 22-year-old scored 14 goals in 44 games in his first season, but after knee surgery last summer, he has stepped up his game this season.\n\nIn only 33 appearances, he has scored 26 goals. In the Champions League, he scored four goals against teams like Barcelona, Bayern Munich, and Ajax.\n\nHis reputation has only risen as a result of this. He might be an excellent summer signing for the Red Devils as they try to build a long-term strategy under a new permanent management.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo has made an impression in his homecoming season, scoring 18 goals, but he is past his prime. In 2022, the Portuguese have only scored four goals.\n\nHe has elected to stay with the club for the coming season, and the next manager may have the option of playing with two up fronts, with the new acquisition alongside Ronaldo.\n\nArsenal and Atletico Madrid have taken notice of Nunez's outstanding scoring heroics for Benfica. The former is likewise in serious need of a new center-forward.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether United is willing to spend a significant amount of money on Nunez.

Davanti a lui, staccato di solo una rete, c\u2019\u00e8 Fabio Quagliarella (ancora in attivit\u00e0) e Batistuta a 4 gol.\n\nAvr\u00e0 ancora un po\u2019 di tempo Immobile per decidere visto che il prossimo impegno della Nazionale sar\u00e0 a giugno contro l\u2019Argentina di Leo Messi e poi, per la Nations League, contro Ungheria, Germania (due volte) e Inghilterra.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-164977888469091.jpeg","Account Created Date":"2021-11-26 15:41:02","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-11-26","Interest":"ciro immobile, lazio, nazionale","Sports Events":"World Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"French Film Festival, Made In Prague Festival, Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, International Documentary Festival Amsterdam","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_4","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1297.89,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":319.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":49.759998,"New COVID Cases":8318.0,"New Deaths":465.0,"New Vaccinations":12229439.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"$456,000 Squid Game In Real Life!","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"MrBeast","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Views":55419453.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":6284727.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"it","Title TikaDetect":"it","Narrative LangDetect":"it","Title LangDetect":"it","Translated Narrative":"The hat-trick against Genoa in the championship brought back Ciro Immobile&#39;s smile after the beating with the national team and the failure to qualify for the next World Cup For the second time in a row The major criticisms have come to him who is so prolific in the biancocelesti when he is harmless in front of goal when he wears the national team shirt The future is therefore completely uncertain on the one hand coach Roberto Mancini is pushing for him to find the right motivation to answer the next call-ups on the other there is Maurizio Sarri who instead advised his forward to focus only on Lazio The last word will obviously be of Immobile who at the moment has overtaken Boniperti in the ranking of the best bomber in the history of Serie A with the last goals scored c Fabio Quagliarella still active and Batistuta on goal Immobile will still have some time to decide given that the next match for the national team will be in June against Leo Messi&#39;s Argentina and then for the Nations League against Hungary, Germany twice and England","Translated Title":"Immobile e il suo \u201cincerto\u201d futuro in Nazionale","GeoTopic Name":"England","GeoTopic Latitude":52.16045,"GeoTopic Longitude":-0.70312,"caption_generation":"a collage of photos of a man and a woman","object_recognition":"['ping-pong ball']","toxicity":0.0008441958,"severe_toxicity":0.0000013852,"obscene":0.0000472689,"identity_attack":0.0000938784,"insult":0.0002239483,"threat":0.0000272374,"sexual_explicit":0.000010503},{"Dataset Index":37537,"Story Primary ID":75725,"Story ID":"STY1643042002","User Primary ID":25206,"User ID":"USR1642998339","Gender":null,"Age":21,"Title":"Pushpa collection till date","Narrative":"Pushpa (Hindi) Box Office Update: Allu Arjun Starrer Is The Lone Warrior In Its 6th Week\n92 crores*\u00a0and counting, that\u2019s how the journey been for Pushpa (Hindi) which is now in its sixth week.

Contemporary Afghanistan: Environment of Afghanistan suffered gravely due to the war","Narrative":"Consequence of conflict in Afghanistan continues......\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s environment has suffered greatly from war and drought related damages. In fact the country is facing an environmental crisis. In most parts of the country, people live on the economic margins as nomads, small farmers and feeders, loggers, miners and hunters. Their survival closely depends on their local knowledge of local ecology.\n\nForest coverage has fallen by more than 50 percent. Due to the largely illegal economy, operative during the previous decades, Afghanistan\u2019s forest cover has slowly and steadily been depleted. Forests are found in very fragile mountain ecosystems and once lost, may not be restored ever.\n\nThe forests of the southeast cover only 2 percent of the area of the country and have its own unique biodiversity. In the northern slopes of Hindukush, medicinal herbs and pistachio trees abound. Pistachio industry is endangered. Uprooting of the pistachio trees for extraction of their roots and their export for medicinal properties has been devastating. Until 1980s wild pistachio was one of the major agricultural export items and made a significant contribution to the Afghan economy. Lack of other energy resources has also led to unsustainable use of this precious tree as fuel wood and for use in construction of shelter. Soil quality has been eroded through the lack of care and leeching by repeated poppy harvests.\n\nThe most immediate environmental problem is health impacts caused by biological pathogens in water. Afghanistan has the highest child \u00a0mortality in the world principally caused by diarrhoeal diseases. Unsustainable utilization of groundwater especially at the time of drought has long-term implications. Air pollution around the city of Kabul is among the worst in the world.13 Water shortage is another important concern. It is a constraint on food production needed to feed the growing population and an incentive for cultivating opium, a drought-tolerant cash crop. Only tubewells are able to reach the water table in such cases. One study reported the water table dropping by one meter per year in \u00a0tube well areas.\n\nTo be continued\u2026..","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-163042509341559.png","Account Created Date":"2021-08-31 21:16:10","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-08-31","Interest":"contemporary afghanistan, books, reading","Sports Events":"Paralympic Games, US Open","Associated Film Festivals":"IndieLisboa, Jerusalem Film Festival, Series Mania","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_3","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1067.47,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":306.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":76.110001,"New COVID Cases":41965.0,"New Deaths":460.0,"New Vaccinations":5493614.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME - Official Teaser Trailer (HD)","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Sony Pictures Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Views":58437385.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":2596669.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Consequence of conflict in Afghanistan continues Afghanistan s environment has suffered greatly from war and drought related damages In fact the country is facing an environmental crisis In most parts of the country people live on the economic margins as nomads small farmers and feeders loggers miners and hunters Their survival closely depends on their local knowledge of local ecology Forest coverage has fallen by more than percent Due to the largely illegal economy operative during the previous decades Afghanistan s forest cover has slowly and steadily been depleted Forests are found in very fragile mountain ecosystems and once lost may not be restored ever The forests of the southeast cover only percent of the area of the country and have its own unique biodiversity In the northern slopes of Hindukush medicinal herbs and pistachio trees abound Pistachio industry is endangered Uprooting of the pistachio trees for extraction of their roots and their export for medicinal properties has been devastating Until s wild pistachio was one of the major agricultural export items and made a significant contribution to the Afghan economy Lack of other energy resources has also led to unsustainable use of this precious tree as fuel wood and for use in construction of shelter Soil quality has been eroded through the lack of care and leeching by repeated poppy harvests The most immediate environmental problem is health impacts caused by biological pathogens in water Afghanistan has the highest child mortality in the world principally caused by diarrhoeal diseases Unsustainable utilization of groundwater especially at the time of drought has long term implications Air pollution around the city of Kabul is among the worst in the world Water shortage is another important concern It is a constraint on food production needed to feed the growing population and an incentive for cultivating opium a drought tolerant cash crop Only tubewells are able to reach the water table in such cases One study reported the water table dropping by one meter per year in tube well areas To be continued ","Translated Title":"64.

The flood killed one person and devastated many homes.\nThe muddy water was the residue left over from the extraction of diamonds. The Jagersfontein mine traces its origins to a 50-carat diamond discovery in 1870. Mining began in earnest shortly after that and continued until 1971. Notable diamonds uncovered included the Excelsior and Reitz diamonds.\nAll mining operations produce residue or tailings. Consequently, there are over 200 active tailings facilities in South Africa. While initial extraction removes most of the sought minerals, tailings facilities can become resources once again as extractive technologies improve. As mine grades decline, mining companies are increasingly looking to retreat operations. Retreat operations nevertheless result in tailings dams of their own.\nWhile retreat operations can be carried out under existing mining licenses, it can be unclear how historic dumps, such as at Jagersfontein, can be exploited. In such instances, where a mine has officially closed, mining licences lapse and the legal standing of residue dumps becomes unclear.\nA legal judgement in 2007 led the way for exploitation without a mining licence, enabling the sale of residue dumps with greater ease. This resulted in an ambiguity oversight, which has yet to be addressed, as the judgement implies that governance passes from mine related legislation to factory related legislation.\nTailings dam failures can occur if walls slide on weak foundations, walls fail due to unbalanced stresses or walls are over topped. Previous tragedies in South Africa include the Merriespruit failure in 1994, resulting in 17 fatalities, and the Bafokeng failure in 1974, resulting in 12 fatalities. Heavy rainfall resulted in over-topping at Merriespruit and Bafokeng, but over-topping can also occur due to poor planning.\nRead more:

We wondered whether academically advanced students \u2013 the top 5% of scorers in math and literacy, who are ready for greater academic challenges \u2013 would be placed as gifted irrespective of their socioeconomic background. We examined test scores of third grade students from 2014 to 2019.\n\nWe found that of the 4,330 students who made up the top 5%, 1,310 \u2013 about 30% \u2013 were left out of gifted programming. This rate of identification was about equal across various racial backgrounds, but economic differences mattered. Among low-income students, about 37% were missed, a greater proportion than the overall number.\n\nOnce we statistically controlled for variation in district enrollment, location, region and differences in gifted selection or school policies, being from a low-income family was associated with a 50% lower likelihood of being identified as gifted relative to similar peers from higher-income backgrounds.\n\nWhy it matters\nStates have different gifted identification policies. In Arkansas, students are first nominated by parents, school personnel or community members. Next they are evaluated on multiple measures, including a creativity test. Finally, a team of educators uses all the information to make the placement decision.\n\nNationally, students from disadvantaged communities, such as low-income communities and communities of color, are underrepresented and are less likely to be nominated for gifted programs than other students.\n\nOther research has found that when nomination is a first step, some gifted students are missed, particularly those from low-income backgrounds.\n\nBut screening all students significantly improves the chances that a disadvantaged student who is gifted will be identified for gifted programs.\n\nWe suggest using state standardized tests as universal screeners to increase the number of low-income and other disadvantaged students in gifted programs. \n\nRead more: https:\/\/theconversation.com\/gifted-student-screenings-often-miss-poor-students-who-should-qualify-179062","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165760703380492.png","Account Created Date":"2022-04-20 11:35:32","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-04-20","Interest":"the conversation, united states","Sports Events":"Invictus Games, World Snooker Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"Pan African Film & Arts Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":30.76,"New COVID Cases":2380.0,"New Deaths":56.0,"New Vaccinations":744947.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Watch the uncensored moment Will Smith smacks Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, drops F-bomb","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Guardian News","YouTube Trending Video Category":"News & Politics","YouTube Trending Video Views":97122193.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1427129.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"The big idea High achieving students from low income backgrounds are half as likely to be placed in a gifted program as their more affluent peers according to our new study Arkansas like all the other states has a unique process for identifying gifted kids We wondered whether academically advanced students the top of scorers in math and literacy who are ready for greater academic challenges would be placed as gifted irrespective of their socioeconomic background We examined test scores of third grade students from to We found that of the students who made up the top about were left out of gifted programming This rate of identification was about equal across various racial backgrounds but economic differences mattered Among low income students about were missed a greater proportion than the overall number Once we statistically controlled for variation in district enrollment location region and differences in gifted selection or school policies being from a low income family was associated with a lower likelihood of being identified as gifted relative to similar peers from higher income backgrounds Why it matters States have different gifted identification policies In Arkansas students are first nominated by parents school personnel or community members Next they are evaluated on multiple measures including a creativity test Finally a team of educators uses all the information to make the placement decision Nationally students from disadvantaged communities such as low income communities and communities of color are underrepresented and are less likely to be nominated for gifted programs than other students Other research has found that when nomination is a first step some gifted students are missed particularly those from low income backgrounds But screening all students significantly improves the chances that a disadvantaged student who is gifted will be identified for gifted programs We suggest using state standardized tests as universal screeners to increase the number of low income and other disadvantaged students in gifted programs Read more ","Translated Title":"Gifted-student\u00a0screenings often miss poor students who should\u00a0qualify","GeoTopic Name":"Arkansas","GeoTopic Latitude":34.75037,"GeoTopic Longitude":-92.50044,"caption_generation":"a table topped with plates and bowls of food .","object_recognition":"['volleyball', 'unicycle, monocycle']","toxicity":0.005895326,"severe_toxicity":0.0000124083,"obscene":0.0003073156,"identity_attack":0.0012494153,"insult":0.0011118714,"threat":0.0000641553,"sexual_explicit":0.0000856136},{"Dataset Index":2571,"Story Primary ID":146747,"Story ID":"STY1663730517","User Primary ID":448,"User ID":"USR1612177534","Gender":"male","Age":69,"Title":"Today  International Chai Day.

Sisodia in Delhi excise policy case.\n\nThe raids on Sisodia\u2019s house is in connection with the faulty excise policy of the Delhi government introduced last year.\u00a0\n\nAlthough the excise policy was rolled back after Delhi \u00a0Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena recommended a CBI probe in the irregularities, CBI raided on 10 locations after registering an FIR.\n\nThe FIR alleges irregularities in formulation and execution of Delhi Excise Policy brought in November last year, according to officials.\n\nLG had recommended a CBI probe into the Kejriwal government's Excise

GNCTD Act 1991, Transaction of Business Rules (ToBR)-1993, Delhi Excise Act-2009, and Delhi Excise Rules-2010,\u201d said CBI officials.\n\nApart from this, there were also \"deliberate and gross procedural lapses\" to provide post-tender \"undue benefits to liquor licensees\", said the officials.\n\nHowever, Aam Aadmi Party supremo and Delhi Chief Minister along with Sisodia termed the raids as vendetta politics against their good work.\n\nSisodia said these people are troubled because of the excellent work done by the Delhi government in the health and education Sector.\n\nThat is why ministers of both departments are targeted to stop us from good work in health and education sector, he said \"The allegations against both of us are lies. Truth will come out in court,\" he tweeted.\n\nKejriwal said there were CBI raids before and nothing will come this time as well.\n\nThe CBI on Friday morning conducted raids in connection with Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22, at over 10 locations including the residence of Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia.\n\n\"The day Delhi's Education model was appreciated and Manish Sisodia's photo appeared on the front page of America's biggest newspaper NYT, the Centre sent CBI at the residence of Manish.\n\nRead more\nhttps:\/\/www.newsdrum.in\/national\/cbi-raids-manish-sisodias-house-what-are-the-charges-77750.html","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166088874341938.png","Account Created Date":"2022-09-03 17:45:00","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-09-03","Interest":"newsdrum, arvind kejriwal, manish sisodia, cbi raid, Politics","Sports Events":"World Volleyball Championships (men), US Open","Associated Film Festivals":"Venice International Film Festival 2022, Telluride Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_3","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1128.48,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":363.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":11.22,"New COVID Cases":6809.0,"New Deaths":26.0,"New Vaccinations":2540787.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"BLACKPINK - \u2018Pink Venom\u2019 M\/V","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"BLACKPINK","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Music","YouTube Trending Video Views":245994768.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":12577694.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"By Shailesh Khanduri New Delhi The CBI on Friday carried out searches at over locations in Delhi NCR including the residence of Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia in Delhi excise policy case The raids on Sisodia s house is in connection with the faulty excise policy of the Delhi government introduced last year Although the excise policy was rolled back after Delhi Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena recommended a CBI probe in the irregularities CBI raided on locations after registering an FIR The FIR alleges irregularities in formulation and execution of Delhi Excise Policy brought in November last year according to officials LG had recommended a CBI probe into the Kejriwal government s Excise Policy over alleged violations of rules and procedural lapses The CBI inquiry was recommended on Delhi Chief Secretary s report filed in July showing prima facie violations of GNCTD Act Transaction of Business Rules ToBR Delhi Excise Act and Delhi Excise Rules said CBI officials Apart from this there were also deliberate and gross procedural lapses to provide post tender undue benefits to liquor licensees said the officials However Aam Aadmi Party supremo and Delhi Chief Minister along with Sisodia termed the raids as vendetta politics against their good work Sisodia said these people are troubled because of the excellent work done by the Delhi government in the health and education Sector That is why ministers of both departments are targeted to stop us from good work in health and education sector he said The allegations against both of us are lies Truth will come out in court he tweeted Kejriwal said there were CBI raids before and nothing will come this time as well The CBI on Friday morning conducted raids in connection with Delhi Excise Policy at over locations including the residence of Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia The day Delhi s Education model was appreciated and Manish Sisodia s photo appeared on the front page of America s biggest newspaper NYT the Centre sent CBI at the residence of Manish Read more ","Translated Title":"CBI raids Manish Sisodia\u2019s house \u2013 What are the charges?","GeoTopic Name":"Delhi","GeoTopic Latitude":28.65195,"GeoTopic Longitude":77.23149,"caption_generation":"a group of people standing on top of a lush green field .","object_recognition":"['cliff, drop, drop-off', 'promontory, headland, head, foreland']","toxicity":0.0011399796,"severe_toxicity":0.0000014589,"obscene":0.0000404103,"identity_attack":0.0001049907,"insult":0.0002621138,"threat":0.0000252303,"sexual_explicit":0.0000250561},{"Dataset Index":37042,"Story Primary ID":74505,"Story ID":"STY1642844381","User Primary ID":24714,"User ID":"USR1642843910","Gender":null,"Age":20,"Title":"Butterfly","Narrative":"Butterflies are insects in the macrolepidopteran clade Rhopalocera from the order Lepidoptera, which also includes moths.

And, according to the report, they have reached an agreement with the Spanish international on a Bosman deal.\n\nAfter ten years in England, the versatile defender is eager to return to Spain this summer. At the same time, he does not want to leave Chelsea on bad terms, especially since the club is going through a difficult period as a result of the sanctions imposed by the UK Government.\n\nWith Andreas Christensen set to join Barcelona and Antonio Rudiger reportedly on his way to Juventus, Chelsea will be down to three frontline centre-backs in Trevoh Chalobah, Malang Sarr, and Thiago Silva if Azpilicueta departs as well.\n\nIf Chelsea decides to unilaterally extend his contract by another year, a move would become difficult. Despite this, the Spanish international has agreed to a contract with Bar\u00e7a and will attempt to persuade the club to let him leave for free.\n\nAzpilicueta, who can play anywhere on the backline, would add a lot of value to this Barcelona setup with his versatile nature, leadership, and winning mentality. What remains to be seen is whether the move will take place before the end of the season.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-164777658732675.png","Account Created Date":"2022-03-01 19:51:35","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-03-01","Interest":"barcelona, chelsea, football, andreas christensen, antonio rudiger, news","Sports Events":"Six Nations","Associated Film Festivals":null,"Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1062.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":332.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":37.84,"New COVID Cases":7554.0,"New Deaths":223.0,"New Vaccinations":1495732.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J.

The overall command of the operation was the responsibility of XI Corps headquartered in Peshawar (NWFP), which had been, not long ago, the primary support and logistics base for the Taliban. Raised in 1975, the Corps, comprising two divisions and an independent Armoured Brigade, had acted as a reserve for the two Corps, X and Formation Command Northern Areas (FCNA), deployed on the eastern border with India.\n\nOne of the major operational handicaps for the military was its inexperience in executing military and counter-insurgency operations, particularly in areas populated by Pashtuns.\n\nBesides, the leading unit of the forces, Frontier Corps, was both inept and corrupt, and under the influence of Saudi-funded madrasas and tribal politics. As a series of spectacular failures in the battlefront showed up, it began to dawn on the military leadership that they had another, far more serious, problem at hand.

making moves to free WNBA star Brittney","Narrative":"A week before Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Russian authorities arrested American basketball star Brittney Griner at the Moscow airport. She was charged with drug smuggling after Russian officials allegedly found vape cartridges containing oil derived from cannabis in her luggage.\n\nSince her arrest on Feb. 17, Griner has been locked up in a Russian prison. It\u2019s a stark contrast to her life as a millionaire athlete playing in professional basketball leagues in both the United States and, for the last seven years, Russia, where she earns nearly four times as much as her nearly US$282,000 annual WNBA salary.\n\nSpeculation on the reason for Griner\u2019s arrest centers on Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s alleged desire to use the American star as a geopolitical pawn at a time when U.S.-Russian relations were at their lowest point since the Cold War. And then the Russian invasion of Ukraine occurred, and U.S.-Russian relations have become worse.\n\nAnother American, Paul Whelan, who is white, remains in Russian detention after more than two years since his 2020 conviction on espionage charges.\n\nThough U.S.-Russia relations have gotten worse since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the unexpected release of Trevor Reed on April 28, 2022, was a positive sign for Griner\u2019s supporters.\n\nA former U.S. Marine, Reed was held for the last three years in Russia on charges stemming from an alleged fight with a Russian police officer. He was exchanged for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot serving a 20-year federal sentence for conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the United States.\n\nSuch an exchange may be in the works with Griner.\n\nAfter nearly three months of silence on Griner, the Biden administration on May 3 declared that Griner had been \u201cwrongfully detained\u201d and, as such, the U.S. government would work more aggressively to secure her release even while the Russian legal case against Griner proceeds.\n\nRead more- https:\/\/theconversation.com\/after-initial-silence-the-biden-administration-is-making-moves-to-free-wnba-star-brittney-griner-from-russian-detention-181821","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165312881997212.png","Account Created Date":"2022-04-20 11:35:32","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-04-20","Interest":"united states, the conversation","Sports Events":"Invictus Games, World Snooker Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"Pan African Film & Arts Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":30.76,"New COVID Cases":2380.0,"New Deaths":56.0,"New Vaccinations":744947.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Watch the uncensored moment Will Smith smacks Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, drops F-bomb","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Guardian News","YouTube Trending Video Category":"News & Politics","YouTube Trending Video Views":97122193.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1427129.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"A week before Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb Russian authorities arrested American basketball star Brittney Griner at the Moscow airport She was charged with drug smuggling after Russian officials allegedly found vape cartridges containing oil derived from cannabis in her luggage Since her arrest on Feb Griner has been locked up in a Russian prison It s a stark contrast to her life as a millionaire athlete playing in professional basketball leagues in both the United States and for the last seven years Russia where she earns nearly four times as much as her nearly US annual WNBA salary Speculation on the reason for Griner s arrest centers on Russian President Vladimir Putin s alleged desire to use the American star as a geopolitical pawn at a time when U S Russian relations were at their lowest point since the Cold War And then the Russian invasion of Ukraine occurred and U S Russian relations have become worse Another American Paul Whelan who is white remains in Russian detention after more than two years since his conviction on espionage charges Though U S Russia relations have gotten worse since Russia s invasion of Ukraine the unexpected release of Trevor Reed on April was a positive sign for Griner s supporters A former U S Marine Reed was held for the last three years in Russia on charges stemming from an alleged fight with a Russian police officer He was exchanged for Konstantin Yaroshenko a Russian pilot serving a year federal sentence for conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the United States Such an exchange may be in the works with Griner After nearly three months of silence on Griner the Biden administration on May declared that Griner had been wrongfully detained and as such the U S government would work more aggressively to secure her release even while the Russian legal case against Griner proceeds Read more ","Translated Title":"After initial silence, the Biden administration is making moves to free WNBA star Brittney","GeoTopic Name":"United States","GeoTopic Latitude":39.76,"GeoTopic Longitude":-98.5,"caption_generation":"a group of people playing a game of tennis .","object_recognition":"['warplane, military plane', 'seashore, coast, seacoast, sea-coast']","toxicity":0.0007406234,"severe_toxicity":0.0000028068,"obscene":0.0000389299,"identity_attack":0.0000809075,"insult":0.0002088586,"threat":0.0000440453,"sexual_explicit":0.0000422701},{"Dataset Index":35475,"Story Primary ID":117603,"Story ID":"STY1658328129","User Primary ID":23748,"User ID":"USR1642618401","Gender":"male","Age":26,"Title":"Milan: De Ketelaere \u00e8 in arrivo","Narrative":"Il Milan sta per chiudere l\u2019operazione che porter\u00e0 il giovane talento belga De Ketelaere in Italia.

Quanto stiamo vedendo, sentendo e leggendo sui media ci sta sconvolgendo e preoccupando anche per i rischi di escalation del conflitto che stanno emergendo negli ultimi giorni.\nLa nostra solidariet\u00e0 \u00e8 rivolta in misura particolare ai civili che stanno subendo profonde limitazioni della libert\u00e0, rischiano la vita assieme ai loro familiari e amici. Occupandosi di scienze legate allo studio della vita, la FISV \u00e8 particolarmente sensibile ai rischi diretti e indiretti che corre la popolazione civile ucraina, ai danni materiali alle infrastrutture cruciali per una sopravvivenza umanamente accettabile, e per il danno ambientale prodotto e indotto dalle azioni militari.\nSiamo una comunit\u00e0 di ricercatori e scienziati e siamo abituati a considerare l\u2019ambito scientifico per sua natura aperto democratico, collaborativo, collettivo e pacifista. A supporto di questa affermazione basti vedere come migliaia di scienziati russi stiano protestando contro la guerra promossa dal loro paese e stiano aderendo a una petizione per fermare il conflitto (https:\/\/trv-science.ru\/2022\/02\/we-are-against-war\/).Tra loro il Premio Nobel per la Fisica Konstantin Novoselov, il precedente consigliere scientifico Roald Sagdeev, e numerosi membri dell\u2019Accademia Russa delle Scienze tra cui Valery Rubakov e Sergey Stishov.\nLa ricerca scientifica non conosce confini.

In an interview with the Independent, Schwartz criticised the caricatured depiction of law enforcement in the series. She also took aim at key plot elements, such as having key witness Glenda Cleveland (played by Niecy Nash) live next door to Dahmer, rather than in the building next door (as in real life).Other dramatisations of real-life crimes have gone much further, adding sensationalist \u2013 and even downright supernatural \u2013 elements to true events.The Haunting of Sharon Tate, written and directed by Daniel Farrands and released in 2019, was universally panned by critics and audiences alike for graphically depicting the real life murder of actress Sharon Tate by the Manson family.In the film, Tate (played by Hilary Duff) has apparent premonitions of her murder in her dreams, with the film ending with a meeting of Manson\u2019s victims in the afterlife. Film critic Owen Gleiberman called the film \u201cpure, unadulterated cheeseball exploitation\u201d opining that it \u201cgoes out of its way to turn the Manson murders into schlock horror\u201d.Read more: https:\/\/theconversation.com\/theyre-making-money-off-tragedy-netflixs-dahmer-series-shows-the-dangers-of-fictionalising-real-horrors-192006","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166538483160142.jpeg","Account Created Date":"2022-04-20 11:35:32","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-04-20","Interest":"Technology, History, Food, Entertainment, Sports, Environment, Science, Inequality, Education, Health, Politics, Economy, Climate change ","Sports Events":"Invictus Games, World Snooker Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"Pan African Film & Arts Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":30.76,"New COVID Cases":2380.0,"New Deaths":56.0,"New Vaccinations":744947.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Watch the uncensored moment Will Smith smacks Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, drops F-bomb","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Guardian News","YouTube Trending Video Category":"News & Politics","YouTube Trending Video Views":97122193.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1427129.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Netflix s recent series Monster The Jeffrey Dahmer Story has stirred controversy over its apparent glamorisation of a serial killer and perceived insensitivity towards the families of Dahmer s victims In contrast to more journalistic true crime entertainment which has its own issues the dramatisation and fictionalisation of real life crimes such as Dahmer has drawn a wave of criticism for re traumatising victims and their loved ones and glorifying criminals Artistic license or sensationalist schlock Whether presenting itself as an accurate retelling or merely inspired by true events there is always going to be some artistic license when transforming a complex true crime story into a movie or TV series While changes from real life to screen are often relatively minor such as having multiple police officers represented by one fictionalised detective others can significantly misrepresent events Anne Schwartz the journalist who broke the original Dahmer story has called the recent Dahmer Netflix series not a helpful representation In an interview with the Independent Schwartz criticised the caricatured depiction of law enforcement in the series She also took aim at key plot elements such as having key witness Glenda Cleveland played by Niecy Nash live next door to Dahmer rather than in the building next door as in real life Other dramatisations of real life crimes have gone much further adding sensationalist and even downright supernatural elements to true events The Haunting of Sharon Tate written and directed by Daniel Farrands and released in was universally panned by critics and audiences alike for graphically depicting the real life murder of actress Sharon Tate by the Manson family In the film Tate played by Hilary Duff has apparent premonitions of her murder in her dreams with the film ending with a meeting of Manson s victims in the afterlife Film critic Owen Gleiberman called the film pure unadulterated cheeseball exploitation opining that it goes out of its way to turn the Manson murders into schlock horror Read more ","Translated Title":"\u2018They\u2019re making money off tragedy\u2019 \u2013 Netflix\u2019s Dahmer series shows the dangers of fictionalising","GeoTopic Name":"Dahmer","GeoTopic Latitude":38.56956,"GeoTopic Longitude":-79.32643,"caption_generation":"a fire hydrant in the middle of a forest .","object_recognition":"[\"pajama, pyjama, pj's, jammies\", 'jean, blue jean, denim']","toxicity":0.0006258251,"severe_toxicity":0.0000015144,"obscene":0.0000339004,"identity_attack":0.0001380521,"insult":0.0001386159,"threat":0.000025595,"sexual_explicit":0.0000138406},{"Dataset Index":44907,"Story Primary ID":106031,"Story ID":"STY1654776588","User Primary ID":28653,"User ID":"USR1646144495","Gender":"male","Age":30,"Title":"UEFA Nations League 22-23: Portugal vs Czech Repuclic preview, prediction & live stream","Narrative":"On matchday 3 of the UEFA Nations League 2022-23, Portugal will face Czech Republic in the\nearly hours of Friday, June 10 at the magnificent Estadio Jose Alvalade in Lisbon.\n\nThe game will\nbegin at 12:15 a.m. IST (Indian Standard Time).\n\nNow that the matches are being played at regular intervals, Fernando Santos of Portugal may\ndecide to shuffle his players for this encounter.

Christ?","Narrative":"Mashiach, or Messiah in English, is a Hebrew term that means the same thing. So, while the Bible uses it both ways, Christ is more of a title than a name. The Bible, for example, frequently refers to Jesus as \"Jesus Christ,\" just as we do in modern language (see Matthew 1:1, 18; Mark 1:1; John 1:17; 17:3; Acts 3:6; Romans 3:24, etc.).\n\nHowever, it also refers to Jesus as \"the Christ,\" which means \"anointed one,\" or \"Messiah.\" When Jesus asked His disciples who they believed He was, \"Who do you think I am,\" Peter said, \u201cYou are the Christ, the Son of the living God\u201d (Matthew 16:16). And He [Jesus], rebuking them, forbade them from speaking, for they realised He was the Christ\" (Luke 4:41).\n\nAs a result, Jesus Christ unites His name (Jesus) with His title (Christ), resulting in Jesus Christ, the Anointed One or Jesus Christ, the Chosen One. As the chosen, anointed Son of God, Jesus is His personal name, as told to Mary by the angel Gabriel (Luke 1:31), and Christ is His title.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165074241646213.png","Account Created Date":"2022-03-14 20:14:35","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-03-14","Interest":"christianity, bible","Sports Events":"Six Nations, ODI World Cup for women","Associated Film Festivals":"SXSW 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1062.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":332.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":28.0,"New COVID Cases":2568.0,"New Deaths":97.0,"New Vaccinations":1795410.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J.

These life events and stress can bring on feelings of sadness or depression or make a mood disorder harder to manage.\"\nThe risk of depression in women is nearly twice as high as in men. Once a family member has this diagnosis, their brothers, sisters, or children have a higher chance of the same diagnosis. In addition, relatives of people with depression are also at increased risk for bipolar disorder.\nOnce a person in the family has a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, the chance for their brothers, sisters, or children to have the same diagnosis is increased.

water is one of the refreshing drinks, and if you have lived in tropical areas, you would know it better.\n\nBesides its refreshing effects, coconut water has been used for a long for health care practices.\nCoconut water contains natural electrolytes, including potassium, magnesium, phosphorus and more. The electrolytes in coconut water can help to regulate fluid balance, prevent dehydration and even ensure proper muscle function. Of course, you'll also want to ensure you refuel with enough carbohydrates and protein post-workout.\n\nApart from this, coconut water is a good source of hydration. This makes it suitable for the skin too.\nLack of hydration can make your skin look dry and tight. But drinking coconut water daily would promote radiant skin.\n\nFresh Coconut water is beneficial in weight loss management programs. It is lower in calories than other beverages, like soda or juices, that help to lose weight. One cup of Coconut water contains only 48 calories. \n\nAs coconut water is also an excellent replacement for sugary drinks, completely swapping artificial drinks for coconut water may help manage weight and boost hydration. \n\nThere are instances such as fatigue and stress where you feel lethargic and don\u2019t want to eat or do anything. Sipping on a cup of Coconut water may help you relax and calm your mind. \n\nSo don't wait to add coconut water to your regime; it won't disappoint you!","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165912820899790.png","Account Created Date":"2022-04-25 22:13:55","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-04-25","Interest":"Health, coconut water","Sports Events":"World Snooker Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"Pan African Film & Arts Festival 2022, Atlanta Film Festival 2022, Milwaukee Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":29.91,"New COVID Cases":11.0,"New Deaths":0.0,"New Vaccinations":863847.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Watch the uncensored moment Will Smith smacks Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, drops F-bomb","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Guardian News","YouTube Trending Video Category":"News & Politics","YouTube Trending Video Views":97686146.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1435733.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Coconut water is one of the refreshing drinks and if you have lived in tropical areas you would know it better Besides its refreshing effects coconut water has been used for a long for health care practices Coconut water contains natural electrolytes including potassium magnesium phosphorus and more The electrolytes in coconut water can help to regulate fluid balance prevent dehydration and even ensure proper muscle function Of course you ll also want to ensure you refuel with enough carbohydrates and protein post workout Apart from this coconut water is a good source of hydration This makes it suitable for the skin too Lack of hydration can make your skin look dry and tight But drinking coconut water daily would promote radiant skin Fresh Coconut water is beneficial in weight loss management programs It is lower in calories than other beverages like soda or juices that help to lose weight One cup of Coconut water contains only calories As coconut water is also an excellent replacement for sugary drinks completely swapping artificial drinks for coconut water may help manage weight and boost hydration There are instances such as fatigue and stress where you feel lethargic and don t want to eat or do anything Sipping on a cup of Coconut water may help you relax and calm your mind So don t wait to add coconut water to your regime it won t disappoint you ","Translated Title":"Why choose coconut water?","GeoTopic Name":null,"GeoTopic Latitude":null,"GeoTopic Longitude":null,"caption_generation":"a group of men playing a game of soccer .","object_recognition":"['stethoscope', 'tripod']","toxicity":0.0021987935,"severe_toxicity":0.0000077109,"obscene":0.0001106968,"identity_attack":0.0007459188,"insult":0.000404672,"threat":0.0000450964,"sexual_explicit":0.0000422709},{"Dataset Index":48985,"Story Primary ID":126891,"Story ID":"STY1660517776","User Primary ID":28996,"User ID":"USR1647270911","Gender":"others","Age":19,"Title":"Um... there's a 'human meat' plant-based burger","Narrative":"I guess I might have puked in my mouth a little.\n\nLol, kidding!

The burden was estimated by sex, age groups, and socio-demographic index (SDI) in 21 countries. \n\nResults \n\nOver the past 30 years, regional incidence, prevalence, mortality, and DALYs of T1DM increase by 188.7%, 304.8%, 43.7%, and 71.6%, respectively. While the age-standardized incidence and prevalence rates increased by 84% and 91%, the mortality and DALYs rates decreased by 34% and 13%. During these years, the contribution of YLDs to total DALYs increased considerably (from 17% to 42%). The highest increase in the incidence and prevalence rates occurred in high SDI countries. Moreover, the Mortality to Incidence Ratio (MIR) decreased in the region countries. \n\nConclusions \n\nDespite progress made in diabetes care, there is a persistently increasing burden of T1DM in the region countries. This indicates that T1DM is still one of the major health challenges in the region countries, especially in high SDI Arab countries. \n\nSources\u00a0 - https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0168822722007264","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-163912484487897.jpeg","Account Created Date":"2021-11-11 17:32:26","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-11-11","Interest":"diabetes","Sports Events":"ICC World T20 (men)","Associated Film Festivals":"French Film Festival, Thessaloniki International Film Festival, European Film Forum SCANORAMA, London Korean Film Festival, Geneva International Film Festival, Cork International Film Festival, Made In Prague Festival, American Film Festival, Stockholm International Film Festival, DOC NYC","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_4","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1297.89,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":319.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":53.290001,"New COVID Cases":12516.0,"New Deaths":501.0,"New Vaccinations":4969221.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, Silk Sonic - Smokin Out The Window [Official Music Video]","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Bruno Mars","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Music","YouTube Trending Video Views":23035962.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":925761.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Shahnaz Esmaeili Farshad Farzadfar Abstract Aims We aimed to report the burden of type diabetes mellitus T DM in the North Africa and Middle East region and its countries from to Methods Information related to incidence prevalence mortality disability adjusted life years DALYs and years lived with disability YLDs of T DM was acquired from the Global Burden of Disease study The burden was estimated by sex age groups and socio demographic index SDI in countries Results Over the past years regional incidence prevalence mortality and DALYs of T DM increase by and respectively While the age standardized incidence and prevalence rates increased by and the mortality and DALYs rates decreased by and During these years the contribution of YLDs to total DALYs increased considerably from to The highest increase in the incidence and prevalence rates occurred in high SDI countries Moreover the Mortality to Incidence Ratio MIR decreased in the region countries Conclusions Despite progress made in diabetes care there is a persistently increasing burden of T DM in the region countries This indicates that T DM is still one of the major health challenges in the region countries especially in high SDI Arab countries Sources ","Translated Title":"Burden of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus in the North Africa and Middle East Region, 1990-2019","GeoTopic Name":"The Dalles","GeoTopic Latitude":45.59456,"GeoTopic Longitude":-121.17868,"caption_generation":"a street sign on the side of a road .","object_recognition":"['tench, Tinca tinca', \"potter's wheel\"]","toxicity":0.0016103137,"severe_toxicity":0.0000024114,"obscene":0.0000673799,"identity_attack":0.0001088184,"insult":0.0004025779,"threat":0.0000671549,"sexual_explicit":0.000037332},{"Dataset Index":31342,"Story Primary ID":94371,"Story ID":"STY1650225962","User Primary ID":22890,"User ID":"USR1642432836","Gender":null,"Age":21,"Title":"Rizzoli, Fabbri Editori, Novit\u00e0 aprile-maggio 2022: Lezioni di Chimica","Narrative":"Lezioni di chimica\u00a0e\u0300 stato il titolo piu\u0300 conteso sul mercato internazionale del 2020.\u00a0In corso\u00a0di pubblicazione in 34 Paesi, \u00e8 l'esordio narrativo di\u00a0Bonnie Garmus\u00a0che, attraverso la protagonista di questo romanzo, ha voluto creare un personaggio che diventasse il portavoce di chiunque si sia mai sentito osteggiato, diffamato o sottovalutato.\u00a0Siamo nel 1952\u00a0ed Elizabeth Zott\u00a0e\u0300 una giovane chimica dell\u2019Hastings Research Institute in California, ambiente ferocemente maschilista dove il suo talento viene messo a tacere.\u00a0Ma la vita, come la scienza, e\u0300 soggetta a trasformazioni\u00a0e qualche anno dopo\u00a0Elizabeth, ora madre single, folgora un produttore televisivo che\u00a0le affida la conduzione di un programma di cucina.

Though Robinson was a fierce competitor, an outstanding athlete and a deeply\u00a0religious man, the aspect of his legacy that often gets glossed over is that he was also a radical.\n\nThe sanitized version of the Jackie Robinson story goes something like this: He was a remarkable athlete who,\u00a0with his unusual level of self-control, was the perfect person to break baseball\u2019s color line. In the face of jeers and taunts, he was able to put his head down and let his play do the talking, becoming a symbol of the promise of a racially integrated society.\n\nWith this April 15 marking the 75th anniversary of Jackie Robinson\u2019s breaking baseball\u2019s color line, Major League Baseball will celebrate the occasion with great fanfare \u2013 with\u00a0tributes, movies,\u00a0TV specials,\u00a0museum exhibits\u00a0and\u00a0symposia.\n\nRead more here: https:\/\/theconversation.com\/jackie-robinson-was-a-radical-dont-listen-to-the-sanitized-version-of-history-179732","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165053490912258.png","Account Created Date":"2022-04-20 11:35:32","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-04-20","Interest":"Sports, the conversation","Sports Events":"Invictus Games, World Snooker Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"Pan African Film & Arts Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":30.76,"New COVID Cases":2380.0,"New Deaths":56.0,"New Vaccinations":744947.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Watch the uncensored moment Will Smith smacks Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, drops F-bomb","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Guardian News","YouTube Trending Video Category":"News & Politics","YouTube Trending Video Views":97122193.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1427129.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"In our new book Baseball Rebels The Players People and Social Movements That Shook Up the Game and Changed America Rob Elias and I profile the many iconoclasts dissenters and mavericks who defied baseball s and society s establishment But none took as many risks and had as big an impact as Jackie Robinson Though Robinson was a fierce competitor an outstanding athlete and a deeply religious man the aspect of his legacy that often gets glossed over is that he was also a radical The sanitized version of the Jackie Robinson story goes something like this He was a remarkable athlete who with his unusual level of self control was the perfect person to break baseball s color line In the face of jeers and taunts he was able to put his head down and let his play do the talking becoming a symbol of the promise of a racially integrated society With this April marking the th anniversary of Jackie Robinson s breaking baseball s color line Major League Baseball will celebrate the occasion with great fanfare with tributes movies TV specials museum exhibits and symposia Read more here ","Translated Title":"Jackie Robinson was a radical \u2013 don\u2019t listen to the sanitized version of\u00a0history","GeoTopic Name":null,"GeoTopic Latitude":null,"GeoTopic Longitude":null,"caption_generation":"a woman in a white dress holding a wii controller .","object_recognition":"['groom, bridegroom', 'suit, suit of clothes']","toxicity":0.0008185133,"severe_toxicity":0.0000028246,"obscene":0.0001253631,"identity_attack":0.0000988036,"insult":0.0002505814,"threat":0.0000323638,"sexual_explicit":0.0000271878},{"Dataset Index":836,"Story Primary ID":122722,"Story ID":"STY1659851789","User Primary ID":21,"User ID":"USR1605632983","Gender":"male","Age":44,"Title":"Amazing Avinash Sable","Narrative":"Podiums by countries in 3000m steeplechase since the 1998 CWG \n\n1998: 2002: 2006: 2010: 2014: 2018:  all three Kenya. \n\n\n2022 ( see the picture) This is the magnitude of Avinash Sable's silver..","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-16598516677519.png","Account Created Date":"2020-11-17 22:39:43","Date (No Timestamp)":"2020-11-17","Interest":"commonwealthgames22","Sports Events":null,"Associated Film Festivals":"Sans Souci Festival of Dance Cinema, Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival, Philadelphia Jewish Film Festival, Doc NYC, Chicago International Children's Film Festival","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2020_4","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":911.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":265.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":39.27,"New COVID Cases":8912904.0,"New Deaths":130993.0,"New Vaccinations":0.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Billie Eilish -

This might seem as a good solution to cope up with our mental health but we cannot forget how this is a short term solution.\nIn the long run, excessive gaming is associated with a variety of negative psychosocial effects. Studies have found that video game addicts tend to have poorer mental health and cognitive functioning, including poorer impulse control and more ADHD symptoms when compared with control groups.

One cannot have his or her personal opinion.\n\nThat is not the case with Manish Tewari. He often takes a contrasting stand from that of his party on different issues.\n\nThough some may say that this is an indication of democracy in the Congress, the larger point is that it also shows confusion in the party on issues.\n\nAnd who benefits from that is known to all. Take for example, his support for the government\u2019s Agnipath and Agniveer scheme. I am not going into merits and de-merits of the scheme but as a member of a political party, one has to go with the party.\n\nIf everybody starts speaking in different tunes, the discipline in the party will go for a toss. Does anyone in the ruling BJP speak against the party or the government? Except a few cryptic tweets by Varun Gandhi, I have seen none.\n\nTewari has also often spoken about the party\u2019s internal matters in public and the rivals of the Congress have used his remarks to attack it.\n\nTewari, a former union minister, has been mulling various options since 2014. First, he refused to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Ludhiana fearing a loss from the constituency. He even got himself admitted to a hospital to avoid contesting the election.\n\nIn the 2017 Punjab elections, there was a huge buzz that he will join the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). It is said that AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s unwillingness to name him or Navjot Singh Sidhu the party\u2019s chief ministerial candidate forced them to abandon their plan to join the new party.\n\nHe fought the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Sri Anandpur Sahib and won mainly due to the efforts of the then Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh.\n\nApart from being a member of the group of 23 dissenters who sought organisational reforms, he had criticised UPA government in his new book over its reaction to the 26\/11 Mumbai terror attacks.\u00a0Why this realisation now and not when he was a minister.\u00a0","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166021552527210.png","Account Created Date":"2021-01-15 17:08:37","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-01-15","Interest":"manish tewari, congress","Sports Events":"World Championships (men)","Associated Film Festivals":null,"Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":770.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":280.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":50.310001,"New COVID Cases":92557.0,"New Deaths":1094.0,"New Vaccinations":0.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"The Weeknd -

Millions of people have been killed and an estimated 5.6 million others displaced by civil wars, local feuds and cross-border conflicts. The neighbouring countries of Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda have been locked into this ongoing cycle, too.The First Congo War began in 1996, with a coalition of the DRC\u2019s neighbours supporting a rebel group that toppled the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. Laurent Kabila was installed as head of state in 1997. A year later, however, a bloodier war began amid violent jostling for power and influence.In December 2002, a peace deal was signed. The DRC got a national army and new constitution. Democratic elections were held in 2006, the country\u2019s first in more than 40 years.But the violence soon resumed. Consolidating peace efforts across the vast territory proved difficult. Since then, the Congo has received tens of billions of dollars in humanitarian aid and hosts one of the largest United Nations peacekeeping missions.Various studies have fronted several reasons for the persistence of war in the Congo. These include flaws in the 2002 peace deal, a Congolese elite that benefits from the chaos and ethnic intolerance.The events that have shaped the DRC mean different things to different actors. The fact that Africa\u2019s largest country has over 250 ethnic groups gives a sense of the complexity of its plight.My research adds to debate on the factors driving the violence. I focused on the narratives of Banyamulenge soldiers. The Banyamulenge are a sub-group of the Congolese Tutsi ethnic group, and originally come from the province of South Kivu in eastern DRC.They are an important constituency to consider because their experiences offer a window into past and current Congolese conflicts.They illustrate how violence in the Congo multiplies across borders, blurs the lines between victim and perpetrator, and is used to win a place in government rather than to overthrow it.Read more: https:\/\/theconversation.com\/burundis-gatumba-massacre-offers-a-window-into-the-past-and-future-of-the-drc-conflict-191351","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166477760394784.jpeg","Account Created Date":"2022-04-20 11:35:32","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-04-20","Interest":"Technology, History, Food, Entertainment, Sports, Environment, Science, Inequality, Education, Health, Politics, Economy, Climate change ","Sports Events":"Invictus Games, World Snooker Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"Pan African Film & Arts Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":30.76,"New COVID Cases":2380.0,"New Deaths":56.0,"New Vaccinations":744947.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Watch the uncensored moment Will Smith smacks Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, drops F-bomb","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Guardian News","YouTube Trending Video Category":"News & Politics","YouTube Trending Video Views":97122193.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1427129.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"For nearly three decades the Democratic Republic of Congo DRC has been embroiled in violence Millions of people have been killed and an estimated million others displaced by civil wars local feuds and cross border conflicts The neighbouring countries of Uganda Burundi and Rwanda have been locked into this ongoing cycle too The First Congo War began in with a coalition of the DRC s neighbours supporting a rebel group that toppled the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko Laurent Kabila was installed as head of state in A year later however a bloodier war began amid violent jostling for power and influence In December a peace deal was signed The DRC got a national army and new constitution Democratic elections were held in the country s first in more than years But the violence soon resumed Consolidating peace efforts across the vast territory proved difficult Since then the Congo has received tens of billions of dollars in humanitarian aid and hosts one of the largest United Nations peacekeeping missions Various studies have fronted several reasons for the persistence of war in the Congo These include flaws in the peace deal a Congolese elite that benefits from the chaos and ethnic intolerance The events that have shaped the DRC mean different things to different actors The fact that Africa s largest country has over ethnic groups gives a sense of the complexity of its plight My research adds to debate on the factors driving the violence I focused on the narratives of Banyamulenge soldiers The Banyamulenge are a sub group of the Congolese Tutsi ethnic group and originally come from the province of South Kivu in eastern DRC They are an important constituency to consider because their experiences offer a window into past and current Congolese conflicts They illustrate how violence in the Congo multiplies across borders blurs the lines between victim and perpetrator and is used to win a place in government rather than to overthrow it Read more ","Translated Title":"Burundi\u2019s Gatumba massacre offers a window into the past and future of the DRC conflict","GeoTopic Name":"Democratic Republic of the Congo","GeoTopic Latitude":-2.5,"GeoTopic Longitude":23.5,"caption_generation":"a view of a mountain range with mountains in the background .","object_recognition":"['cloak', 'abaya']","toxicity":0.0005371368,"severe_toxicity":0.000001238,"obscene":0.0000372749,"identity_attack":0.0000536115,"insult":0.0001598781,"threat":0.0000156376,"sexual_explicit":0.0000167549},{"Dataset Index":13951,"Story Primary ID":147536,"Story ID":"STY1663892073","User Primary ID":9723,"User ID":"USR1635047515","Gender":"male","Age":24,"Title":"Shop in Your Own Closet","Narrative":"Do you ever feel like you want to go shopping but don\u2019t want to spend money?

It was only another friend and doctor who was a radiologist, who knew and pointed out that what the treating team was doing was wrong. \n\nI felt that if I'm someone who is a teacher, who is a doctor in this hospital, who is famous, who is known, who is openly trans, and in spite of that, that it can happen to me, then naturally it can happen to any trans person, especially those who are less privileged.\n\nWe started this conversation when I was associated with Amir, Satendra, Anant -- we were working on a project, and were like, 'We need to do something about it.'\n\nThat conversation led to writing this project, and that's how we started the journey of TransCare. While this is my personal experience, I'm sure there are thousands of such experiences. \n\nThat is why we started this work on trying to find out what kind of barriers trans people face when accessing healthcare. And I'm really happy to say that in less than two years, the amount of work that we're doing has evolved and has grown gradually. \n\nNow we have an umbrella under which we do our work in the marginalized communities, especially with transgender people, and people with disability. It's called iHEAR initiative -- initiative for health equity, advocacy and research.\n\nIt involves doing community-based participatory research; advocacy for the rights of community members; doing capacity building for committee members and for people who want to serve the community; creating inclusive and safe spaces for the community members. \n\nWe have academics, researchers, activists, and also allies, who are part of the team. Now, it's very important that when we do work in the communities, that we do it with them, and we involve the community in every stage. \n\nThat's why the iHEAR projects bring together community members, and when I say community members, the community is not a single block: there's a lot of diversity and intersectionality within the community. \n\nContinued: https:\/\/www.pixstory.com\/story\/we-dont-want-to-just-publish-in-lancet-unless-ground-reality-of-trans-people-changesdr-aqsa1652120836\/99364","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165211978286489.jpeg","Account Created Date":"2022-05-02 12:32:30","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-05-02","Interest":"Health, Inequality, Education, transgender rights, transgender, transgender community, transgender healthcare, transcare, transcare conference","Sports Events":"World Snooker Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"Milwaukee Film Festival 2022, Indie Lisboa 2022, Hotdocs 2022, Lucca Film Festival e Europa Cinema 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":29.52,"New COVID Cases":2568.0,"New Deaths":20.0,"New Vaccinations":834417.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Watch the uncensored moment Will Smith smacks Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, drops F-bomb","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Guardian News","YouTube Trending Video Category":"News & Politics","YouTube Trending Video Views":98158438.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1442406.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":" continued I was started on a combination of antibiotics which I didn t need It was only another friend and doctor who was a radiologist who knew and pointed out that what the treating team was doing was wrong I felt that if I m someone who is a teacher who is a doctor in this hospital who is famous who is known who is openly trans and in spite of that that it can happen to me then naturally it can happen to any trans person especially those who are less privileged We started this conversation when I was associated with Amir Satendra Anant we were working on a project and were like We need to do something about it That conversation led to writing this project and that s how we started the journey of TransCare While this is my personal experience I m sure there are thousands of such experiences That is why we started this work on trying to find out what kind of barriers trans people face when accessing healthcare And I m really happy to say that in less than two years the amount of work that we re doing has evolved and has grown gradually Now we have an umbrella under which we do our work in the marginalized communities especially with transgender people and people with disability It s called iHEAR initiative initiative for health equity advocacy and research It involves doing community based participatory research advocacy for the rights of community members doing capacity building for committee members and for people who want to serve the community creating inclusive and safe spaces for the community members We have academics researchers activists and also allies who are part of the team Now it s very important that when we do work in the communities that we do it with them and we involve the community in every stage That s why the iHEAR projects bring together community members and when I say community members the community is not a single block there s a lot of diversity and intersectionality within the community Continued ","Translated Title":"The Story Behind TransCare MedEd | The community is not a single block: Dr Aqsa Shaikh","GeoTopic Name":"TransCare Medical Services","GeoTopic Latitude":61.18433,"GeoTopic Longitude":-149.89412,"caption_generation":"a kite is flying high in the sky .","object_recognition":"['monitor', 'bulletproof vest']","toxicity":0.0003720726,"severe_toxicity":0.0000012826,"obscene":0.0000283356,"identity_attack":0.0000631654,"insult":0.0001049924,"threat":0.0000163342,"sexual_explicit":0.000012377},{"Dataset Index":27974,"Story Primary ID":97467,"Story ID":"STY1651246409","User Primary ID":20802,"User ID":"USR1642092657","Gender":"male","Age":33,"Title":"MotoGP Spagna: Quartararo il pi\u00f9 rapido nelle FP2, Bagnaia terzo!","Narrative":"Continuano a cambiare i rapporti di forza anche nella seconda sessione di prove libere del GP di Spagna della classe regina delle due ruote.

For every awful act that occurs, police officers perform hundreds of thousands of nice deeds every day, which are never covered on social media and never by the mainstream media.\n\nBelievers of ACAB are nothing but ungrateful citizens. While you're home with your families, there are hundreds of thousands of men and women in blue who leave their families at home, and go to work each day so that when you're in trouble, they put their lives on the line, and eventually take the bullet for you.\n\nPersonally, I don't think it's fair to assume that everyone in a group is evil. It's simply not true, and I find it shocking that so many civilians are so quick to accuse law enforcement of wrongdoing - especially when you examine their rationale. While cops sometimes make mistakes, my experience has taught me that those that believe ACAB is breaking the law and don't want to be found out are likely to do so. Of course, it is a generalisation, and I'm sure there are times when that dread is justified. However, it happens far less frequently than one might assume! However, this pessimistic mindset frequently prevents the vision from being dispelled. Everyone is wrong if one is incorrect. It's illogical, and it hurts law enforcement all over the world.\n\nBad attitudes have pervaded our society since its inception, and keeping it on a level keel has been a constant effort. What other career, aside from law enforcement, expects more of a person while providing no remuneration for erroneous thinking on behalf of the wider public? It's a mob mentality, with no requirement for people to physically show up in the town square. Without concern for the end outcome, the internet allows us to propagate misinformation, make judgments, intimidate people, and influence thinking.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-164909829473919.png","Account Created Date":"2022-03-14 21:59:44","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-03-14","Interest":"pro police, men in blue, back the blue","Sports Events":"Six Nations, ODI World Cup for women","Associated Film Festivals":"SXSW 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1062.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":332.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":28.0,"New COVID Cases":2568.0,"New Deaths":97.0,"New Vaccinations":1795410.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J.

practical?","Narrative":"\u200cDiscussions are going to make the UK smoke free by 2030. Dr Nveed Chaudhary who has previously worked for tobacco giants Philip Morris, British American Tobacco and Imperial, praised British public health policy for being world-leading already in promoting e-cigarette alternatives to traditional \u201ccombustible\u201d smoking. But he said the review offers a chance to make a dramatic big step which could have an impact around the globe. Britain banning smoking and introducing vaping would save many lives according to Nveed. \n\u200c\n\u200cWe all know what happens to the things being banned. It comes back illegally increasing crimes. Chaudary has also said that there should be an action to see a change.  He also advises that doctors could suggest these to the patients who are chain smokers. \n\u200c\n\u200cSmoking is dangerous we have no doubt. Traditional or electronic! We have no control over this addiction. The electronic cigarette is also harmful. So better to treat people who are addicted or ban it completely rather than placing alternatives for them. This will only benefit the e-cigarette companies and no one else. The Cigarette ban should be a slow process so that smokers get time to process it and the use of alternatives isn't a very practical aspect of it.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165255163556456.png","Account Created Date":"2022-04-22 21:29:53","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-04-22","Interest":"smoking ban","Sports Events":"Invictus Games, World Snooker Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"Pan African Film & Arts Festival 2022, Atlanta Film Festival 2022, Milwaukee Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":29.76,"New COVID Cases":2527.0,"New Deaths":33.0,"New Vaccinations":1958838.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Watch the uncensored moment Will Smith smacks Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, drops F-bomb","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Guardian News","YouTube Trending Video Category":"News & Politics","YouTube Trending Video Views":97348983.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1430594.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":" Discussions are going to make the UK smoke free by Dr Nveed Chaudhary who has previously worked for tobacco giants Philip Morris British American Tobacco and Imperial praised British public health policy for being world leading already in promoting e cigarette alternatives to traditional combustible smoking But he said the review offers a chance to make a dramatic big step which could have an impact around the globe Britain banning smoking and introducing vaping would save many lives according to Nveed We all know what happens to the things being banned It comes back illegally increasing crimes Chaudary has also said that there should be an action to see a change He also advises that doctors could suggest these to the patients who are chain smokers Smoking is dangerous we have no doubt Traditional or electronic We have no control over this addiction The electronic cigarette is also harmful So better to treat people who are addicted or ban it completely rather than placing alternatives for them This will only benefit the e cigarette companies and no one else The Cigarette ban should be a slow process so that smokers get time to process it and the use of alternatives isn t a very practical aspect of it ","Translated Title":"Will Cigarette ban in UK be practical?","GeoTopic Name":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland","GeoTopic Latitude":54.75844,"GeoTopic Longitude":-2.69531,"caption_generation":"a group of people standing next to each other .","object_recognition":"['book jacket, dust cover, dust jacket, dust wrapper', 'web site, website, internet site, site']","toxicity":0.0007928885,"severe_toxicity":0.0000025402,"obscene":0.0000761224,"identity_attack":0.00011813,"insult":0.000254802,"threat":0.0000177871,"sexual_explicit":0.0000946197},{"Dataset Index":58565,"Story Primary ID":124973,"Story ID":"STY1660296326","User Primary ID":34600,"User ID":"USR1651665373","Gender":"male","Age":61,"Title":"Museo camera","Narrative":"The Union Minister of State for External Affairs , Mrs Meenakshi Lekhi inaugurates a painting and a vintage cameras exhibition in the' Museo Camera' museum at Gurugram.

She took an ice pick to a block of chocolate, added it to her cookie dough, and the chocolate chip cookie was born.

said on Saturday.\nBilled as a trilogy, the first installment of the big-budget fantasy adventure epic starring Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, and Amitabh Bachchan was released on Friday.\n\"'Brahmastra Part One: Shiva' has delivered a massive opening day of Rs. 75 crore (GBOC), igniting celebrations across the country, the film industry, theatre owners and audiences, with the weekend total expected to be huge!\" according to a note shared by production banners Star Studios and Dharma Productions.\nWhile the movie has received mixed reviews from critics for its story and dialogues, many praised

franchises.\n\"Brahmastra Part One: Shiva\" follows a deejay named Shiva, who sets out on a journey to find the origins of his special powers with Isha (Bhatt), a woman he falls in love with on first

Anfield loss destroys Top 4 hopes","Narrative":"It was dismal, unremarkable and all in all terrible football from Manchester United as they\nlost to Liverpool in the Premier league late on Tuesday. The hosts scored four without reply\nas they catch onto United's rivals City in the title race which continues to intensify.\n\n United\nmeanwhile, have gone from one low to another. If last week's loss against relegation\ncandidates Everton meant anything this game has only helped reconfirm the same.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo rescued a 3-2 win over Norwich at the weekend but he wasn't present at\nAnfield, where the Merseyside club ran all over Ralf Ragnick's side. The lack of intensity,\ndesire and organisation was basically what Liverpool took advantage of, United were by all\nmeans \u2014 outclassed. \n\nThe likes of Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire once again caught\nheadlines for under par performances while Jadon Sancho caught the eye.\n\nFor Jurgen Klopp's team, Sadie Mane and Mo Salah ran riot. The two wingers were\nrampant, making up for three of their team's four goals on the night. Midfielder Thiago\nAlcantara bossed the game for the Reds, making United's players look like amateurs.\n\n A\nrebuild is in the works at United, Ragnick confirmed with the imminent appointment of Erik\nTen Hag. Bruno Fernandes claimed Liverpool were fighting for the title while his side did not\nhave the same competitive desires.\n\nCR7's absence obviously played a role but it isn't to say that United's catastrophic defending\nwouldn't have lost them the game anyways.

The true number of infections is likely to be significantly higher. But there is no reason to think testing has dropped off significantly in the past two weeks, or even in the past few months.\n\nThe levelling off and subsequent decline of cases fits with the wave naturally reaching a peak. The amount of virus being detected in wastewater has also decreased in the past week. Altogether this means the fall in cases is likely to be real.\n\nImportantly, cases have been falling in all age groups, including over-70s. This is particularly good news because the increase in case rates in older age groups had been a key driver of the steep rise in hospitalisations and deaths in this wave.\n\nWe may yet see an increase in cases in families with school-age children as they returned to school this week after the winter holiday break. But this is unlikely to be enough to reverse the falling trend, and hopefully won\u2019t affect older age groups to the same extent.\nHospitalisations typically lag behind cases by a week or two. Consistent with this pattern, the number of people in hospital with COVID has recently shown signs of levelling off. It will probably start to fall in the coming week.\n\nImmunity from the first Omicron wave\nThe BA.5 variant is driving the current wave. BA.5 has taken over from BA.2 as the dominant variant in New Zealand, as it has in other countries.\n\nRead more: https:\/\/theconversation.com\/new-zealands-latest-covid-wave-is-levelling-off-with-fewer-people-in-hospital-than-feared-187773","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165908378965663.png","Account Created Date":"2022-04-20 11:35:32","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-04-20","Interest":"the conversation, new zealand","Sports Events":"Invictus Games, World Snooker Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"Pan African Film & Arts Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":30.76,"New COVID Cases":2380.0,"New Deaths":56.0,"New Vaccinations":744947.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Watch the uncensored moment Will Smith smacks Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, drops F-bomb","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Guardian News","YouTube Trending Video Category":"News & Politics","YouTube Trending Video Views":97122193.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1427129.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"New Zealand has likely passed the peak of the most recent COVID wave thanks to strong hybrid immunity in the community and with the number of hospitalisations at the lower end of what was originally expected The seven day rolling average of new daily cases has fallen steadily from a peak of around on July to just under yesterday The number of reported cases depends on how many people actually test when they feel unwell The true number of infections is likely to be significantly higher But there is no reason to think testing has dropped off significantly in the past two weeks or even in the past few months The levelling off and subsequent decline of cases fits with the wave naturally reaching a peak The amount of virus being detected in wastewater has also decreased in the past week Altogether this means the fall in cases is likely to be real Importantly cases have been falling in all age groups including over s This is particularly good news because the increase in case rates in older age groups had been a key driver of the steep rise in hospitalisations and deaths in this wave We may yet see an increase in cases in families with school age children as they returned to school this week after the winter holiday break But this is unlikely to be enough to reverse the falling trend and hopefully won t affect older age groups to the same extent Hospitalisations typically lag behind cases by a week or two Consistent with this pattern the number of people in hospital with COVID has recently shown signs of levelling off It will probably start to fall in the coming week Immunity from the first Omicron wave The BA variant is driving the current wave BA has taken over from BA as the dominant variant in New Zealand as it has in other countries Read more ","Translated Title":"New Zealand\u2019s latest COVID wave is levelling off, with fewer people in hospital than\u00a0feared","GeoTopic Name":"New Zealand","GeoTopic Latitude":-42.0,"GeoTopic Longitude":174.0,"caption_generation":"a red fire hydrant sitting in the middle of a forest .","object_recognition":"[\"pajama, pyjama, pj's, jammies\", 'shower cap']","toxicity":0.0075717648,"severe_toxicity":0.0000976538,"obscene":0.0004013316,"identity_attack":0.0009799583,"insult":0.0024280965,"threat":0.000582712,"sexual_explicit":0.0002162911},{"Dataset Index":53272,"Story Primary ID":128768,"Story ID":"STY1660810555","User Primary ID":32675,"User ID":"USR1650434732","Gender":null,"Age":21,"Title":"Academic freedom and democracy in African countries: the first study to track the\u00a0connection","Narrative":"There is growing interest in the state of academic freedom worldwide. A 1997 Unesco document defines it as the right of scholars to teach, discuss, research, publish, express opinions about systems and participate in academic bodies. Academic freedom is a cornerstone of education and knowledge.\n\nYet there is surprisingly little empirical research on the actual impact of academic freedom. Comparable measurements have also been scarce. It was only in 2020 that a worldwide index of academic freedom was launched by the Varieties of Democracy database, V-Dem, in collaboration with the Scholars at Risk Network.\n\nFollowing Unesco\u2019s definition, the new index provides a comprehensive measurement of academic freedom. It covers research, teaching and expression as well as university autonomy and campus safety. It reveals that while the average level of academic freedom today is higher than before the end of the Cold War, the decline over the past 10 years is remarkable. Academic freedom has declined from 0.6 in 2009 to 0.43 in 2021 in a range of 0.00 to 1.00.\n\nAdvocacy groups have noted scholars\u2019 deteriorating freedom of expression and working conditions in Turkey, for instance. This reflects global trends in civil liberties and human rights. Declines have been observed in the regions where academic freedom is greatest \u2013 Europe and North America \u2013 and in the least free regions: the Middle East and North Africa. In Africa overall, the level has been relatively stable: 0.58 in 2009 and 0.57 in 2021.\n\nThe positive effects of universities on local economies have been researched extensively. Recent approaches have also looked at wider societal impacts. Most notable is the Times Higher Education Impact Rankings assessing universities against the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This shows a great variety of rankings in different goals. Universities high in SDG 4 \u2013 quality education \u2013 are not necessarily high in SDG 16 \u2013 peace, justice and strong institutions, which includes academic freedom.\n\nRead more: https:\/\/theconversation.com\/academic-freedom-and-democracy-in-african-countries-the-first-study-to-track-the-connection-186579","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166081042442238.png","Account Created Date":"2022-04-20 11:35:00","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-04-20","Interest":"the conversation","Sports Events":"Invictus Games, World Snooker Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"Pan African Film & Arts Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":30.76,"New COVID Cases":2380.0,"New Deaths":56.0,"New Vaccinations":744947.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Watch the uncensored moment Will Smith smacks Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, drops F-bomb","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Guardian News","YouTube Trending Video Category":"News & Politics","YouTube Trending Video Views":97122193.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1427129.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"There is growing interest in the state of academic freedom worldwide A Unesco document defines it as the right of scholars to teach discuss research publish express opinions about systems and participate in academic bodies Academic freedom is a cornerstone of education and knowledge Yet there is surprisingly little empirical research on the actual impact of academic freedom Comparable measurements have also been scarce It was only in that a worldwide index of academic freedom was launched by the Varieties of Democracy database V Dem in collaboration with the Scholars at Risk Network Following Unesco s definition the new index provides a comprehensive measurement of academic freedom It covers research teaching and expression as well as university autonomy and campus safety It reveals that while the average level of academic freedom today is higher than before the end of the Cold War the decline over the past years is remarkable Academic freedom has declined from in to in in a range of to Advocacy groups have noted scholars deteriorating freedom of expression and working conditions in Turkey for instance This reflects global trends in civil liberties and human rights Declines have been observed in the regions where academic freedom is greatest Europe and North America and in the least free regions the Middle East and North Africa In Africa overall the level has been relatively stable in and in The positive effects of universities on local economies have been researched extensively Recent approaches have also looked at wider societal impacts Most notable is the Times Higher Education Impact Rankings assessing universities against the UN Sustainable Development Goals SDGs This shows a great variety of rankings in different goals Universities high in SDG quality education are not necessarily high in SDG peace justice and strong institutions which includes academic freedom Read more ","Translated Title":"Academic freedom and democracy in African countries: the first study to track the\u00a0connection","GeoTopic Name":null,"GeoTopic Latitude":null,"GeoTopic Longitude":null,"caption_generation":"a close up of a pair of scissors","object_recognition":"['web site, website, internet site, site']","toxicity":0.0008806956,"severe_toxicity":0.0000043875,"obscene":0.0000551818,"identity_attack":0.0002945446,"insult":0.0002945564,"threat":0.0000273553,"sexual_explicit":0.0000812677},{"Dataset Index":46706,"Story Primary ID":109988,"Story ID":"STY1656227221","User Primary ID":28729,"User ID":"USR1646386582","Gender":null,"Age":12,"Title":"PM\u2019s address in the 90th Episode of \u2018Mann Ki Baat\u2019","Narrative":"Hello my dear countrymen Namaskar!

to heart disease?","Narrative":"You are probably well-aware that smoking leads to asthma, emphysema and lung cancer, but did you also know it is also a contributing factor to heart disease?\nWhen you light up a cigarette or cigar, you are potentially causing a buildup of fatty substances in your arteries, known as atherosclerosis. Yet another reason to kick your smoking habit for good.\nSmoking is a major cause of coronary heart disease (CHD), in which the arteries of the heart can\u2019t supply the heart muscle with enough oxygen-rich blood. CHD is the main cause of heart attacks, and it\u2019s the leading cause of death in the United States.\nSmoking causes high blood pressure, lowers your ability to exercise, and makes your blood more likely to clot. It also lowers HDL (good) cholesterol levels in the blood. All of these are risk factors for heart attacks and strokes.\nSmoking is a major risk factor for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). In PAD, plaque builds up in the arteries that carry blood to the head, organs, and limbs. This increases your risk of heart disease, heart attack, and stroke.\nSmoking increases the risk of having an aortic aneurysm. This is a balloon-like bulge in the aorta, the main artery carrying blood from the heart to other organs. It is caused by a weakening of the wall of the aorta. Aortic aneurysms can grow larger over time, and they can be life threatening if they rupture (break open).\nSmoking can cause or worsen poor blood flow to the arms and legs, which is called peripheral vascular disease or (PVD). This can lead to pain in the legs when walking, and may lead to open sores that don\u2019t heal.\nBecause smoking affects blood flow, it can lower the body\u2019s ability to heal from cuts.

Churches are unquestionably one of the attractions in Rome. Rome is a historical, cultural, artistic, and culinary mecca. There are several layers of history here. Rome is too historical to not enjoy while visiting. It is an ancient city with a history that dates back almost 3,000 years. Its history is as fascinating as Rome itself and is rife with myths and legends. This makes this site so lovely in itself. There are remnants of history everywhere you look.\n\nArt galleries, museums, the sculptures, of course the catholic churches, Colosseum and whatnot. But that's not it, rome offers so much more than just the typical tourist attractions. Just by deviating from the main tourist routes, you can uncover incredible gems. Restaurants and patios can be found everywhere. Rome, like they say, is the eternal city and you'll fall in love with it eternally.\n\nSo to answer that question, Rome is definitely worthwhile!","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165791965634687.png","Account Created Date":"2022-06-04 07:50:58","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-06-04","Interest":"rome, italy, travel","Sports Events":"French Open, NBA Finals","Associated Film Festivals":"Docaviv 2022, Doc Edge 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":14.49,"New COVID Cases":4270.0,"New Deaths":15.0,"New Vaccinations":1304882.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"NCT DREAM \uc5d4\uc2dc\ud2f0 \ub4dc\ub9bc 'Beatbox' MV","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"SMTOWN","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Music","YouTube Trending Video Views":42386666.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1326575.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"In Rome even a month would not be enough time to see everything so honestly one visit to this magnificent city does not do it justice Churches are unquestionably one of the attractions in Rome Rome is a historical cultural artistic and culinary mecca There are several layers of history here Rome is too historical to not enjoy while visiting It is an ancient city with a history that dates back almost years Its history is as fascinating as Rome itself and is rife with myths and legends This makes this site so lovely in itself There are remnants of history everywhere you look Art galleries museums the sculptures of course the catholic churches Colosseum and whatnot But that s not it rome offers so much more than just the typical tourist attractions Just by deviating from the main tourist routes you can uncover incredible gems Restaurants and patios can be found everywhere Rome like they say is the eternal city and you ll fall in love with it eternally So to answer that question Rome is definitely worthwhile ","Translated Title":"Is visiting Rome worthwhile?","GeoTopic Name":"Rome","GeoTopic Latitude":41.89193,"GeoTopic Longitude":12.51133,"caption_generation":"a person holding a cell phone in their hand .","object_recognition":"[\"pajama, pyjama, pj's, jammies\", 'gown']","toxicity":0.001433967,"severe_toxicity":0.000001813,"obscene":0.0000674193,"identity_attack":0.0001468434,"insult":0.0002353321,"threat":0.0000447563,"sexual_explicit":0.0000217363},{"Dataset Index":38713,"Story Primary ID":95602,"Story ID":"STY1650466707","User Primary ID":25709,"User ID":"USR1643166496","Gender":"male","Age":31,"Title":"Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez - Old Trafford Bound?","Narrative":"Darwin Gabriel N\u00fa\u00f1ez Ribeiro Is an Uruguayan Professional, who plays for Primera Division club Benfica, one of the powerhouse clubs in the country.\n\n\nHaving come through Pe\u00f1arol's youth academy, he was promoted to the first team in 2017. In 2019, he joined Almeria in the Spanish Segunda division. Benfica got their man for \u20ac24 million in 2020. He was one of the most expensive signings in Portuguese football history.\n\nHe is mostly left attacking midfielder, but this season he has been deployed as a center-forward. In the 50 matches he played, he has been mostly deployed as a center forward.\n\n\nLast year, when he joined Benfica he scored 6 goals in 29 matches. This season he has taken the Primeira Liga by storm, by scoring a whopping 25 goals in 25 matches.\u00a0\nFrom the above picture, we can see that he ranks head and shoulders above other advanced midfielders, in terms of goal taken in total shots which he took.\n\nLooking at his passing stats, we can see that he has done most of his best work when drifting to the left side. We can see that he has received progressive passes mostly in the left-wing\nLooking at his touches, again he has most of the touches in the left-wing and that can\u2019t be classified as a left-winger movement, nor are they centrally enough to confirm, that he is a proper center-forward.\n\nThe Uruguayan can\u2019t just stop scoring. At the rate at which he is scoring, he has overtaken Juventus player Dusan Vlahovic, and Real Madrid or Manchester City-bound Erling Haaland.\u00a0\n\n\nIn the 35 matches that he has played, he scored a whopping 31 goals. With a host of clubs like Manchester United, Atletico Madrid, Chelsea, and Arsenal after the signing of the \u00a364 million man, we could see his price soar up in the summer especially if he continues this rich vein of form.\u00a0\n\n\nManchester United incoming manager Erik Ten Hag will be looking to go for him or Antony or Christopher Nkunku. Nunez could soon turn out to be the hottest number 9 in Europe if he continues his hot run of form","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165046635017812.png","Account Created Date":"2022-01-26 08:38:16","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-01-26","Interest":"darwin nunez, football, benfica, Sports, visualization, football analysis, manchester united fc","Sports Events":"Africa Cup of Nations, Australian Open","Associated Film Festivals":"Sundance Film Festival 2022, International Film Festival Rotterdam 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1062.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":332.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":28.629999,"New COVID Cases":286384.0,"New Deaths":573.0,"New Vaccinations":5871190.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Marvel Studios\u2019 Moon Knight | Official Trailer | Disney+","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Marvel Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Views":26619026.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1077760.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"cy","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"de","Translated Narrative":"Darwin Gabriel N ez Ribeiro Is an Uruguayan Professional who plays for Primera Division club Benfica one of the powerhouse clubs in the country Having come through Pe arol s youth academy he was promoted to the first team in In he joined Almeria in the Spanish Segunda division Benfica got their man for million in He was one of the most expensive signings in Portuguese football history He is mostly left attacking midfielder but this season he has been deployed as a center forward In the matches he played he has been mostly deployed as a center forward Last year when he joined Benfica he scored goals in matches This season he has taken the Primeira Liga by storm by scoring a whopping goals in matches From the above picture we can see that he ranks head and shoulders above other advanced midfielders in terms of goal taken in total shots which he took Looking at his passing stats we can see that he has done most of his best work when drifting to the left side We can see that he has received progressive passes mostly in the left wing Looking at his touches again he has most of the touches in the left wing and that can t be classified as a left winger movement nor are they centrally enough to confirm that he is a proper center forward The Uruguayan can t just stop scoring At the rate at which he is scoring he has overtaken Juventus player Dusan Vlahovic and Real Madrid or Manchester City bound Erling Haaland In the matches that he has played he scored a whopping goals With a host of clubs like Manchester United Atletico Madrid Chelsea and Arsenal after the signing of the million man we could see his price soar up in the summer especially if he continues this rich vein of form Manchester United incoming manager Erik Ten Hag will be looking to go for him or Antony or Christopher Nkunku Nunez could soon turn out to be the hottest number in Europe if he continues his hot run of form","Translated Title":"Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez - Old Trafford Bound?","GeoTopic Name":"Madrid","GeoTopic Latitude":40.4165,"GeoTopic Longitude":-3.70256,"caption_generation":"a white plate topped with a piece of cake .","object_recognition":"['revolver, six-gun, six-shooter']","toxicity":0.014949214,"severe_toxicity":0.0000018565,"obscene":0.0001506761,"identity_attack":0.0002981261,"insult":0.008204375,"threat":0.0000504888,"sexual_explicit":0.000029203},{"Dataset Index":3561,"Story Primary ID":145719,"Story ID":"STY1663574958","User Primary ID":632,"User ID":"USR1613386215","Gender":"others","Age":12,"Title":"Brands to splurge on Connected TV advertising this festive season","Narrative":"By Seha Kumari\nE-commerce, Lifestyle, Auto, FMCG, BFSI, and Ed-tech brands are likely to be big spenders on Connected TVs this festive season. \nThe majority of ad spend, however, is most likely to flow from TV advertising. \nAs per experts, brands are willing to shell out a heavy premium to be on connected TVs as they are able to do precision targeting via this medium. \nShekhar Banerjee\nShekhar Banerjee, Chief Client Officer and Office Head \u2013 West, Wavemaker India, said, \u201cCTV is a priority channel for us and our clients.

custard base is topped with a coating of crispy caramel in cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e (also known as Cambridge burnt cream, crema catalana, or Trinity cream). It's usually served chilled, and the custard foundation is vanilla-flavored. For taste and memories, you can't go wrong with this classic French dessert.\nVirtually identical to the original\u00a0crema catalana,[2]\u00a0is a\u00a0dessert\u00a0consisting of a rich\u00a0custard\u00a0base topped with a layer of hardened caramelized\u00a0sugar.irtually identical to the original\u00a0crema catalana,[2]\u00a0is a\u00a0dessert\u00a0consisting of a rich\u00a0custard\u00a0base topped with a layer of hardened caramelized\u00a0sugar.\nIt is normally served slightly chilled; the heat from the\u00a0caramelizing\u00a0process tends to warm the top of the custard, while leaving the center cool. The custard base is traditionally flavored with\u00a0vanilla\u00a0in\u00a0French cuisine, but can have other flavorings. It is sometimes\u00a0garnished\u00a0with fruit.\nThere are three different tools used to caramelize the sugar and create the crunchy sweet caramel crust on top of the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e:\u2028Culinary Blowtorch*\u00a0(available at kitchen supply and hardware stores \u2013 torch the brown sugar until melted, bubbling and brown. * Be sure to follow the manufacturer\u2019s safety instructions on the blowtorch.)\u2028The Broiler\u00a0(in your oven on High with tray on the top rack. Watch carefully because brown sugar can go from underdone to black burnt in seconds)\u2028Flamb\u00e9 Method\u00a0(a little brandy or rum poured on top of the brown sugar and lit with a flame then blown out when melted, bubbling and brown.)\u2028\nThe ideal result is to caramelize the top of the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e without heating up the custard filling below. In any case, make sure you do not burn the brown sugar\/cr\u00e8me.\u2028\n\n\n\n\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 cup (250 ml) whole milk\u2028\n1 cup (250 ml) (35% fat content) heavy whipping cream ( use any cream

He called his aides to pass a new budget with an aim of \u201cresolving the difficulties of the people\u2019s livelihoods\u201d.\n\nSouth Korea has been an epitome of success in fighting Covid-19, along with New Zealand and the Nordic countries. However, South Korea stands out even among these success stories because it has been able to contain the virus with minimum number of deaths without imposing any full lockdown.\n\nIt developed the strategy very early as it had learnt from its past experiences with outbreaks of H1N1 virus (2009) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) which had overwhelmed the public health system and caught the government off guard. That key to the success of the strategy were three Ts: more \u201ctests\u201d, \u201ctracing\u201d of contacts through sophisticated technology and quick \u201ctreatment\u201d of patients under government monitoring.  \n\nBut with fast growing number of patients and public\u2019s fatigue with strict restrictions the government shifted to a more \u201chands-off\u201d approach. Now people who test positive have been asked to fend for themselves at home.  \n\nBut, for a large number of people, especially those who are poor, the new strategy has left somewhat abandoned, as they have become used to government\u2019s handholding. Some say they are neither getting government guidelines, nor the essential commodities\u2014such as oximeters\u2014in time. \n\nREAD MORE: https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/02\/17\/world\/asia\/south-korea-covid-spread.html\n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2022\/02\/south-korea-resilient-covid-deaths\/622085\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/economy\/2022\/2\/18\/south-korea-extends-business-curfew-as-covid-19-cases-top-100000","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-164544487784230.png","Account Created Date":"2021-02-03 18:21:04","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-02-03","Interest":"omicron, h1n1, mers, new zealand, nordic, three ts","Sports Events":null,"Associated Film Festivals":"Goteborg Film Festival","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":770.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":280.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":59.259998,"New COVID Cases":12899.0,"New Deaths":107.0,"New Vaccinations":310634.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"India claim stunning series win, end Australia's Gabba streak | Vodafone Test Series 2020-21","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"cricket.com.au","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Sports","YouTube Trending Video Views":36105239.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":798671.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"For the first time since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic South Korea s daily Covid cases crossed last week after the authorities decided to ease restrictions before the upcoming presidential election on March Even though Omicron cases had been surging exponentially the government led by President Moon Jae in had to lift some restrictions as there had been backlash from small business owners and a growing disgruntlement of public over the government s heavy handed intervention to control Covid Next month s election perhaps forced the president rethink the strategy as the owners of small business and those who are self employed have become desperate He called his aides to pass a new budget with an aim of resolving the difficulties of the people s livelihoods South Korea has been an epitome of success in fighting Covid along with New Zealand and the Nordic countries However South Korea stands out even among these success stories because it has been able to contain the virus with minimum number of deaths without imposing any full lockdown It developed the strategy very early as it had learnt from its past experiences with outbreaks of H N virus and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome MERS which had overwhelmed the public health system and caught the government off guard That key to the success of the strategy were three Ts more tests tracing of contacts through sophisticated technology and quick treatment of patients under government monitoring But with fast growing number of patients and public s fatigue with strict restrictions the government shifted to a more hands off approach Now people who test positive have been asked to fend for themselves at home But for a large number of people especially those who are poor the new strategy has left somewhat abandoned as they have become used to government s handholding Some say they are neither getting government guidelines nor the essential commodities such as oximeters in time READ MORE ","Translated Title":"Why South Korea changed its strategy to fight Covid 19","GeoTopic Name":"Republic of Korea","GeoTopic Latitude":36.5,"GeoTopic Longitude":127.75,"caption_generation":"a woman sitting on the beach with a dog .","object_recognition":"['parallel bars, bars', 'crutch']","toxicity":0.0014425671,"severe_toxicity":0.0000109114,"obscene":0.0001106474,"identity_attack":0.000888451,"insult":0.0003417865,"threat":0.0000432144,"sexual_explicit":0.0001030894},{"Dataset Index":70365,"Story Primary ID":135914,"Story ID":"STY1662050555","User Primary ID":61058,"User ID":"USR1658500661","Gender":null,"Age":20,"Title":"Gautam Adani becomes the third richest man.","Narrative":"According, to Bloomberg Billionaire Index, chairman of Adani group, Gautam Adani becomes the third richest person in the world with a net worth of $137.4 billion.

It allows the audience to envision falling in love with Humphrey Bogart or Ingrid Bergman. The characters sacrifice their love for the greater good of fighting against the Nazis.\n\nThe film, directed by Ingolstadt Bergman, was made on a tight budget and released with small expectations. In \"Casablanca,\" he plays Rick Blaine, the hard-drinking American running a nightclub in Casablanca. \n\nThe film tells the story of a German prisoner of war, Rick Steves, who moves easily in a corrupt world. The dialogue combines the cynical with the weary; wisecracks with epigrams. We see that Rick's love interest is Ilsa Lund (Bergman), the woman he loved years earlier in Paris. Now she is with Victor Laszlo (Henreid), a legendary hero of the French Resistance.\n\nThey are seen in close-up, and he adds, \"Ilsa, a dramatic musical chord marks their close-ups, and the action plays out in bitterness, sorrow, and the recollection of a love that was true.\" After a second watching, he continues, \"the more you see it, the more resonance the whole film gains.\"\n\nFilm combines suspense, romance and comedy as rarely brought together on the screen. None of the major characters is bad, some are cynical, some lie, some kill, but all are redeemed. Reviewer: \"If I were forced to choose between my country and my friend, I hope I would be brave enough to choose my friend\".\n\nFilmmaker Ingolstadt Bergman played the whole movie without knowing how it would end. The film is not so much brilliant as absolutely sound, rock-solid in its use of Hollywood studio craftsmanship. When this plot was remade in 1990 as \"Havana,\" the film suffered as a result\n\nPlaying like a favourite musical collection is \"Casablanca.\" Contrary to colour, black-and-white film has not aged as well. The dialogue is so terse and caustic that it hasn't become dated.

Stella Creasy, who has pushed for misogyny to be made a crime, called it a major U-turn by Ms. Truss.\n\nThe domestic abuse register being recommended by the foreign secretary would include coercive

partners and their children or face harsh penalties.\n\nMs. Truss has also promised to fasten the process of handling rape cases, as part of a program to build on the government's Violence Against Women and Girls Strategy.\n\nShe said: \"Violence against women and girls doesn't have to be inevitable. Women should be able to walk the streets without fear of harm, and perpetrators must expect to be punished.\n\nThis will be a head start to a great change in ensuring safety for women. The perks of having a woman as the PM of the country are huge. It instills hope in the woman who aims high in politics.

Republic of Ireland preview","Narrative":"Latvia welcomed Andorra to the Daugava Stadium in their UEFA Nations League opener on\nFriday.\n\nIn September 2020, Latvia and Andorra played out a goalless draw to begin their 2020-21\nNations League season.The 11 vilki won their only game of the season with a 5-0 hammering of\nAndorra in the return match, but it wasn't enough to get them promoted to League C.If there is\none thing that is certain, it is that Latvia has a lot of work ahead of them if they are to reclaim\ntheir past glory of almost qualifying for the 2010 World Cup.\n\nWhile Kazakevics and his teammates may be dissatisfied with their one victory last season, it\nwas still one more than Andorra. Koldo Alvarez, who has been in charge for 12 of the 26 years,\nwill be sure to remind his team of the surprises they've pulled off in the past, like their surprise\nwin against Hungary during World Cup qualifying.

Nei loro testi parlano di femminismo, dei diritti LGBT e dell'opposizione al presidente russo Vladimir Putin, che considerano un dittatore.\nHanno acquisito una notoriet\u00e0 globale quando nel 2012 cinque di loro hanno organizzato una preghiera punk all'interno della Cattedrale di Cristo Salvatore di Mosca.\nIl 17 agosto 2012, tre membri delle Pussy Riot - Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Maria Alyokhina ed Ekaterina Samutsevich - sono state condannate dall\u2019autorit\u00e0 russa a due anni di reclusione per \"teppismo motivato dall'odio religioso\".\nIl processo e la sentenza hanno attirato notevole attenzione e critiche, in particolare in Occidente.

The deadliest spider on the planet.\nThey are enormous spiders with large, rearward-facing fangs capable of piercing fingernails. One male, lovingly christened 'Big Boy' by the Australian Reptile Park, measured 10cm stretched out. They are aggressive spiders that are black in colour, the front of their bodies shiny and hairless and their abdomens black or dark plum in colour.\nFemales are sedentary, staying in burrows with their entrances framed by the species' distinctive 'funnel' webbing, which is typically seen behind rocks or logs in suburban gardens and wilderness.\nMales become more active following summer rains, when they start wandering in search of females, and this is when most people come into contact with them. Males are nocturnal and extremely sensitive to sunlight, so they wander at night. If they are unsuccessful in their search for a mate, they will seek shelter for the day, which is when they end up in people's shoes or houses.\nThis little creature holds the power to kill a rabbit?

Leicester City will face Brentford at King Power Stadium and will look to start their campaign on high in front of their fanbase.\u00a0\n\nLeicester City have sold their long serving shot-stopper Kasper Schmeichel to a French club. They have not added players to their midfield which might look weak at the end of the summer transfer window with Youri Tielemans and James Maddisson touted with a move away from King Power Stadium.\n\nBrentford had a great Premier League season in 2021\/22 and will look to replicate the same or make it better. Brentford has made a few high profile signings that make them more favorable to stay in the top-flight.\u00a0\n\nLeicester City vs. Brentford Match Details\n\nMatch: Leicester City vs. Brentford\u00a0\n\nDate and Time: 7th August, 6:30 PM IST\n\nVenue: King Power Stadium\n\nLeicester City vs. Brentford Probable Playing XI\n\nLeicester City: Daniel Iversen; Thomas Amartey, Wesley Fofana, Jonny Evans; James Justin, Wilfred Ndidi, Youri Tielemans, Lucas Castagne; James Maddison, Kelechi Iheanacho; Jamie Vardy\n\nBrentford: Jose Raya; Aaron Hickey, Pontus Jansson, Ben Mee, Rico Henry; Vitaly Janelt, Mathias Jensen, Christian Norgaard; Yoane Wissa, Ivan Toney, Bryan Mbeumo\n\nLeicester City vs. Brentford Probable Winners\n\nLeicester City have failed to add the players to their squad but have sold a lot.

hearing fireworks at Chinese Embassy?","Narrative":"By Abhishek Kumar\nA video of a man in black thwab and a white headgear getting down from a vehicle and greeting another person amidst high security is circulating widely on social media. Further on in the video, the sound of firecrackers can be heard with the security staff immediately escorting the man back into the car and leaving. It has been claimed that the pair seen in white headgear are Saudi Defense Ministers who arrived at the Chinese Embassy to attend Chinese New Year celebrations. Chinese officials had arranged fireworks for their welcome, however, the ministers were unaware of this. As a result, they panicked and the security had to \u2018save\u2019 them. \nTwitter user Anjali Jain also tweeted this video with a similar claim. (Archived link)\n(Tweet)\nJournalist Vivek Tripathi of ABP Ganga also amplified the visuals and accompanying claim. However, he later deleted the tweet. (Archived link)\nTwitter user Jaiky Yadav also promoted the video with the same claim. (Archived link)\nFact-check\nAt first glance, this video seems a bit odd. When the sound of the firecrackers is heard, none of the bystanders move at all. Apart from this, even when the military personnel take the pair away, the people standing there do not move. Rather, they continue recording the festivities on their phones without concern.\nAlt News performed a reverse image search using a frame taken from the video. This led us to an article covering this video on Aos Fatos, a fact-checking website from Brazil. The report refutes the claim made with the video and also contains a tweet dated December 12, 2019, posted by Kuwait\u2019s Al-Hadith news channel. The tweet features a recording of the viral video taken from a different angle. It also states that this is a video of a fake military show by the Amiri guards at the Gulf Defense and AVSON exhibition.\nRead the full story here:-

next quarterly results are not good as Big Tech companies start to lay off workers in the global economic slump.\n\nInsider has access to a company letter from Google Cloud sales leadership in which they threaten staff with a \"overall evaluation of sales productivity and productivity in general\" and warn that \"there will be blood on the streets\" if next quarter's performance \"don't look up.\"\n\nThe sales crew was told that if third quarter numbers \"don't look up, [then] there will be blood on the streets.\" Insider was the first to report the warning.\n\nAccording to The New York

corporation that they risk being let go if they don't deliver results.\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, warned staff members late last month that they needed to increase productivity because of the severe economic challenges.\n\nPichai stated that he was looking for suggestions from his staff on how to achieve \"better results faster.\"\n\nHe was cited as saying, \"There are legitimate concerns that our productivity as a whole is not where it needs to be for the head count we have.\"\n\nIn order to assess its manpower requirements and choose its next line of action, Google froze all hiring in July for a period of two weeks. The corporation has previously stated that hiring would be reduced for the remainder of the year.\n\nWe are clearly confronting a difficult macro climate with increasing uncertainties in the future, according to Pichai.\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet, posted lower-than-anticipated earnings and revenue for the month of April (Q2).\n\nCompared to the same quarter last year, revenue growth dropped to 13% from 62%.\n\nLinkedIn, Meta, Oracle, Twitter, Nvidia, Snap, Uber, Spotify, Intel, and Salesforce are a few notable tech firms that have reduced hiring or laid off workers as a result of the current economic slump.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166064839971374.png","Account Created Date":"2022-07-24 12:53:37","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-07-24","Interest":"google, layoffs, tech news daily, daily tech news, Technology, tech","Sports Events":"Tour de France, IAAF World Championships, Summer X Games, World Police and Fire Games, Tour de France Femmes","Associated Film Festivals":"Melbourne Documentary Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_3","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1128.48,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":363.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":9.96,"New COVID Cases":16866.0,"New Deaths":41.0,"New Vaccinations":2960410.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"STAYC(\uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\uc528) 'BEAUTIFUL MONSTER' MV","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"STAYC","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Views":27730326.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":403289.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Google executives reportedly urged staff to either raise performance or be ready to depart as there will be blood on the streets if the next quarterly results are not good as Big Tech companies start to lay off workers in the global economic slump Insider has access to a company letter from Google Cloud sales leadership in which they threaten staff with a overall evaluation of sales productivity and productivity in general and warn that there will be blood on the streets if next quarter s performance don t look up The sales crew was told that if third quarter numbers don t look up then there will be blood on the streets Insider was the first to report the warning According to The New York Post Google employees are fearful of layoffs after the corporation secretly extended its hiring freeze this month without making an announcement Employees have reportedly been told by the corporation that they risk being let go if they don t deliver results Sundar Pichai CEO of Alphabet and Google warned staff members late last month that they needed to increase productivity because of the severe economic challenges Pichai stated that he was looking for suggestions from his staff on how to achieve better results faster He was cited as saying There are legitimate concerns that our productivity as a whole is not where it needs to be for the head count we have In order to assess its manpower requirements and choose its next line of action Google froze all hiring in July for a period of two weeks The corporation has previously stated that hiring would be reduced for the remainder of the year We are clearly confronting a difficult macro climate with increasing uncertainties in the future according to Pichai Google s parent company Alphabet posted lower than anticipated earnings and revenue for the month of April Q Compared to the same quarter last year revenue growth dropped to from LinkedIn Meta Oracle Twitter Nvidia Snap Uber Spotify Intel and Salesforce are a few notable tech firms that have reduced hiring or laid off workers as a result of the current economic slump ","Translated Title":"Google executives issue a warning to staff about layoffs: \"There will be blood on the streets.","GeoTopic Name":null,"GeoTopic Latitude":null,"GeoTopic Longitude":null,"caption_generation":"a group of people standing next to each other .","object_recognition":"[\"dragonfly, darning needle, devil's darning needle, sewing needle, snake feeder, snake doctor, mosquito hawk, skeeter hawk\", 'damselfly']","toxicity":0.018646767,"severe_toxicity":0.0000035258,"obscene":0.0003332689,"identity_attack":0.0001847768,"insult":0.002619808,"threat":0.000355308,"sexual_explicit":0.0000870891},{"Dataset Index":63598,"Story Primary ID":129591,"Story ID":"STY1660933974","User Primary ID":44334,"User ID":"USR1655228976","Gender":null,"Age":25,"Title":"One Punch Man Season 3 officially announced","Narrative":"\u00a0After a long time it is finally happening. One Punch Man is finally getting a Season 3, coming over 3 years after the second one ended. One Punch Man officially revealed it will be returning for a third season of the anime, though details about the upcoming season are pretty scarce at the moment unfortunately. Nonetheless, the confirmation of a new season is nonetheless a huge victory for the fans who have been asking for it for a while now. Created by ONE and originally published as a webcomic in 2009, a digital manga remake with some key differences in the storyline and refined illustrations by Yusuke Murata began publication on Shueisha\u2019s Tonari no Young Jump website in June 2012.\n\nViz Media licensed the remake manga in English language and are serializing it in Weekly Shonen Jump. An anime adaptation produced by studio Madhouse aired from October to December 2015. J.C. Staff took over for season 2, which aired from April to July 2019.\n\nCrunchyroll, which streams the anime in Europe and North America, provided the following description for One Punch Man Season 3: \u201cSaitama started out being a hero just for fun. After three years of \u201cspecial\u201d training, he became so powerful that he can defeat opponents with a single punch. Now, alongside Genos, his faithful cyborg disciple, Saitama is ready to begin his official duties as a professional hero working with the Hero Association. However, the frequency of monster appearances is surging and it increasingly appears as if the Great Seer Madame Shibabawa\u2019s prediction about the Earth\u2019s doom is coming true. In the midst of this crisis, the \u201chero hunter\u201d Garou makes his own appearance.\u201d\n\nThe first season was produced by Studio Madhouse, while the second season saw production duties shifting over to J.C. Staff. Currently, it is unclear who will be handling production for Season 3 or what arc of One Punch Man it will cover. Season 1 covered the Alien Conquerors Arc while the second kicked off the start of the Monster Association arc within the grander Human Monster Saga. The third one might possibly stop at, or cover the Awakened Garou Arc.\u00a0\u00a0","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166093391312096.png","Account Created Date":"2022-06-14 23:19:00","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-06-14","Interest":"anime","Sports Events":"NBA Finals","Associated Film Festivals":"Doc Edge 2022, Sydney Film Festival 2022, Tribeca Film Festival 2022, Annecy International Animation Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":11.91,"New COVID Cases":8822.0,"New Deaths":15.0,"New Vaccinations":1582434.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"BTS (\ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8) 'Yet To Come (The Most Beautiful Moment)' Official MV","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"HYBE LABELS","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Music","YouTube Trending Video Views":80996833.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":9114143.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":" After a long time it is finally happening One Punch Man is finally getting a Season coming over years after the second one ended One Punch Man officially revealed it will be returning for a third season of the anime though details about the upcoming season are pretty scarce at the moment unfortunately Nonetheless the confirmation of a new season is nonetheless a huge victory for the fans who have been asking for it for a while now Created by ONE and originally published as a webcomic in a digital manga remake with some key differences in the storyline and refined illustrations by Yusuke Murata began publication on Shueisha s Tonari no Young Jump website in June Viz Media licensed the remake manga in English language and are serializing it in Weekly Shonen Jump An anime adaptation produced by studio Madhouse aired from October to December J C Staff took over for season which aired from April to July Crunchyroll which streams the anime in Europe and North America provided the following description for One Punch Man Season Saitama started out being a hero just for fun After three years of special training he became so powerful that he can defeat opponents with a single punch Now alongside Genos his faithful cyborg disciple Saitama is ready to begin his official duties as a professional hero working with the Hero Association However the frequency of monster appearances is surging and it increasingly appears as if the Great Seer Madame Shibabawa s prediction about the Earth s doom is coming true In the midst of this crisis the hero hunter Garou makes his own appearance The first season was produced by Studio Madhouse while the second season saw production duties shifting over to J C Staff Currently it is unclear who will be handling production for Season or what arc of One Punch Man it will cover Season covered the Alien Conquerors Arc while the second kicked off the start of the Monster Association arc within the grander Human Monster Saga The third one might possibly stop at or cover the Awakened Garou Arc ","Translated Title":"One Punch Man Season 3 officially announced","GeoTopic Name":"Europe","GeoTopic Latitude":48.69096,"GeoTopic Longitude":9.14062,"caption_generation":"a group of teddy bears sitting on top of a table .","object_recognition":"['street sign', 'jinrikisha, ricksha, rickshaw']","toxicity":0.0010727512,"severe_toxicity":0.0000015973,"obscene":0.0000682161,"identity_attack":0.0000946103,"insult":0.0002792458,"threat":0.0000279505,"sexual_explicit":0.0000172521},{"Dataset Index":49487,"Story Primary ID":88544,"Story ID":"STY1647808203","User Primary ID":28999,"User ID":"USR1647276503","Gender":"male","Age":22,"Title":"TRENDING: Memphis, Gonzaga, Sweet-16","Narrative":"Memphis, Gonzaga and Sweet-16 have been trending today on twitter with hundreds of thousands of tweets.\n\nGonzaga leaned on its star junior to reach its seventh straight Sweet 16 after trailing at intermission for only the fourth time this season.

The music is made up of heavy guitar riffs, usually played in a minor key, accompanied by shreddy guitar solos, bombastic drums, aggressive loud vocals with other instrumentation such as keys, synthesizers etc. The themes can vary from anything from religion, society, war, fantasy, philosophy etc.\n\nThe styles are many such as heavy metal, thrash, death, groove, progressive, black metal, symphonic, power, metalcore etc. Another sub genre exists within heavy metal which is heavily looked down upon by most metalheads and not even considered as part of heavy metal, that is called glam\/hair metal.\n\nHair metal or glam metal was the most dominant form of rock music in the 80s, spearheaded by bands such as Motley Crue, Quiet Riot, Dokken, Ratt, Twisted Sister, Bon Jovi etc. Inspired from Kiss and Hanoi Rocks, these bands played a softer type of heavy rock music with topics only ranging from drugs, partying, girls, sex and booze, while putting on make up and dressing up like girls. Even musically they had little variety following the same 4\/4 progression, playing its songs in the major key, it was basically the pop of metal.\n\nLos Angeles was the epicentre of glam metal. While bands like Motley Crue genuinely played heavy metal, this trend turned into corporate rock, with bands first copying Def Leppard, which was imitated by Motley Crue and Quiet Riot, then Bon Jovi, Poison etc. This wave of copy cat bands having attractive guys one after the other making sissy music became way too artificial for most.\nHell, hair metal has been dead for 40 years and even the newer metalheads speak smack over it. But is it really bad? Speaking strictly from the viewpoint of a lifelong metalhead, no. While later hair bands certainly began churning out too many power ballads, the early tunes of Motley Crue and Dokken were very attitude filled and headbangable.

Ukrainians, equipped with sophisticated weapons supplied by the US and its NATO allies, have been destroying Russian tanks and have successfully halted their advances in many areas. Meanwhile, Russia has been deploying more and more lethal weapons killing thousands of innocent civilians, including sick children in hospitals.\n\nLet\u2019s have a look at the key weapons of defence by Ukrainians as well as Russians\u2019 destructive devices in the warfront. One of the key weapons of resistance by Ukrainians is Javelin, the anti-tank missile that can be carried on the shoulder of a lone soldier and fired with ease, after a short training. Tried and tested in the warfronts at Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria, by US forces, Ukrainians too have successfully used them to make columns of Russian tanks explode. A similar, fire-and-forget Next Generation Light Anti-tank Weapon (NLAW), supplied by the UK, also bolstered Ukraine\u2019s military. Stinger missiles, developed by the US Army, are also shoulder-fired and help Ukrainians deal with low-flying Russian airplanes and combat helicopters. Consignment of Kamikaze, or Switchblade drones, packed with explosives have destroyed Russian tanks and troops.  \n\nCompared to these desperate Russia have been using highly destructive hypersonic missiles to target Ukraine\u2019s ammunition and oil storage facilities. They\u2019ve used lethal thermobaric bombs that asphyxiates civilians, by sucking out oxygen from the victim\u2019s lungs, and even vaporise humans. The Russians also fired cluster munitions that opened mid-air and scattered thousands of explosive submunitions, killing hundreds in crowded urban areas, including hospitals and residential areas. These munitions are deemed illegal according to international law and targeting civilians with all these weapons clearly violates the Geneva Conventions.  \n\nAnd, now that the Russian aggression has hit a stalemate their military seems poised to launch even more lethal weapons, such as nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, to subdue Ukrainians and capture the key cities.     \n\nREAD MORE: \n\nhttps:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/explain\/2022\/03\/25\/us\/weapons-ukraine-war\n\nhttps:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/2022\/03\/23\/russia-ukraine-weapons-missiles-nukes-drones\/\n\nhttps:\/\/graphics.reuters.com\/UKRAINE-CRISIS\/WEAPONS\/lbvgnzdnlpq\/","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-164846953023389.png","Account Created Date":"2021-02-03 18:21:04","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-02-03","Interest":"javelin, nlaws, stinger, switchblade, cluster munitions, thermobaric, geneva conventions","Sports Events":null,"Associated Film Festivals":"Goteborg Film Festival","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":770.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":280.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":59.259998,"New COVID Cases":12899.0,"New Deaths":107.0,"New Vaccinations":310634.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"India claim stunning series win, end Australia's Gabba streak | Vodafone Test Series 2020-21","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"cricket.com.au","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Sports","YouTube Trending Video Views":36105239.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":798671.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Russia s Ukraine invasion doesn t show any sign of ending as the invaders become more desperate after facing an unexpected resistance by Ukraine s army and its determined civilians Ukrainians equipped with sophisticated weapons supplied by the US and its NATO allies have been destroying Russian tanks and have successfully halted their advances in many areas Meanwhile Russia has been deploying more and more lethal weapons killing thousands of innocent civilians including sick children in hospitals Let s have a look at the key weapons of defence by Ukrainians as well as Russians destructive devices in the warfront One of the key weapons of resistance by Ukrainians is Javelin the anti tank missile that can be carried on the shoulder of a lone soldier and fired with ease after a short training Tried and tested in the warfronts at Afghanistan Iraq Libya and Syria by US forces Ukrainians too have successfully used them to make columns of Russian tanks explode A similar fire and forget Next Generation Light Anti tank Weapon NLAW supplied by the UK also bolstered Ukraine s military Stinger missiles developed by the US Army are also shoulder fired and help Ukrainians deal with low flying Russian airplanes and combat helicopters Consignment of Kamikaze or Switchblade drones packed with explosives have destroyed Russian tanks and troops Compared to these desperate Russia have been using highly destructive hypersonic missiles to target Ukraine s ammunition and oil storage facilities They ve used lethal thermobaric bombs that asphyxiates civilians by sucking out oxygen from the victim s lungs and even vaporise humans The Russians also fired cluster munitions that opened mid air and scattered thousands of explosive submunitions killing hundreds in crowded urban areas including hospitals and residential areas These munitions are deemed illegal according to international law and targeting civilians with all these weapons clearly violates the Geneva Conventions And now that the Russian aggression has hit a stalemate their military seems poised to launch even more lethal weapons such as nuclear chemical and biological weapons to subdue Ukrainians and capture the key cities READ MORE ","Translated Title":"What are the key weapons being used in Ukraine war","GeoTopic Name":"Russian Federation","GeoTopic Latitude":60.0,"GeoTopic Longitude":100.0,"caption_generation":"a group of people sitting in a room .","object_recognition":"['rugby ball', 'soccer ball']","toxicity":0.0016049532,"severe_toxicity":0.0000029871,"obscene":0.0001026547,"identity_attack":0.0001470378,"insult":0.0002741694,"threat":0.0000236799,"sexual_explicit":0.0002382651},{"Dataset Index":33946,"Story Primary ID":115016,"Story ID":"STY1657475713","User Primary ID":23515,"User ID":"USR1642587832","Gender":null,"Age":23,"Title":"Una squadra di Capri sogna l\u2019acquisto di Mertens","Narrative":"Il Givova Capri Anacapri sogna in grande.

But also the souls of themartyrs, whose stories echo throughout the streets of this famous hill station. The mountains of Darjeeling are home to the mighty Gorkhas. \n\nFor the past 36 years, Darjeeling has been fighting for its lost identity and statehood. The Gorkhas do not dream the same dream as the Bengal government. Since Independence, the Gorkhas have been living as foreigners in their own country. The country for which Gorkhas like Dal Bahadur Giri, Helen Lepcha, Krishna Bhadur Mukhia, etc shed their blood, sweat, and tears. \n\nThe past three decades also saw the rise of three agitations. The bloodiest being the \"Agitation of 1986.\" The memories of which still haunt a mother whose son was decapitated, a wife whose husband never returned from the market, a father whose daughter was shot dead before his own eyes. The CPRF also torched houses, raped women and silenced everyone that spoke against the government. \n\nOn 12th May 1986, an innocent Gorkha residing from Panighatta was denounced a terrorist and shot dead, in broad daylight. The events of Panighatta turned the tide of the agitation. And what was once a peaceful protest now turned into a bloody warfare. \n\nAnother significant event of the \"86 Agitation\" was the massacre of 27th July. On this day, a peaceful protest was held at Main Road Kalimpong to challenge \"The Treaty of Nepal,\" also known as \"Sugaulo Sandhi.\" The treaty designed by the Indian government, imposed restrictions on Gorkhas traveling to Nepal. The peaceful protest turned into a bloodbath when the CRPF opened fire, killing 19 and injuring hundreds. The incident also caught the eye of BBC, who condemned the actions of the Indian government. Whereas the government still continued to ignore the atrocities committed by CRPF.\n\nAccording to the government record, a total of 1200 Gorkhas, were decimated. And thousands were swept under the carpet. \n\nTo the day, India will see us as their own\nTo the day, our people have their own identity and their land\nWe are fighting not drowning \nJai Gorkha Jai Gorkhaland.\n\nSiddarth Kharga","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165094868175177.png","Account Created Date":"2022-02-14 18:20:51","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-02-14","Interest":"gorkha, History, untold stories","Sports Events":"Winter Olympics, Six Nations","Associated Film Festivals":"Berlin International Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1062.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":332.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":39.619999,"New COVID Cases":27409.0,"New Deaths":347.0,"New Vaccinations":1817599.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Jurassic World Dominion - Official Trailer [HD]","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Universal Pictures","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Views":28996578.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":682154.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Situated amongst the mighty peaks of the Himalayas Darjeeling is not only enveloped by serene landscapes But also the souls of themartyrs whose stories echo throughout the streets of this famous hill station The mountains of Darjeeling are home to the mighty Gorkhas For the past years Darjeeling has been fighting for its lost identity and statehood The Gorkhas do not dream the same dream as the Bengal government Since Independence the Gorkhas have been living as foreigners in their own country The country for which Gorkhas like Dal Bahadur Giri Helen Lepcha Krishna Bhadur Mukhia etc shed their blood sweat and tears The past three decades also saw the rise of three agitations The bloodiest being the Agitation of The memories of which still haunt a mother whose son was decapitated a wife whose husband never returned from the market a father whose daughter was shot dead before his own eyes The CPRF also torched houses raped women and silenced everyone that spoke against the government On th May an innocent Gorkha residing from Panighatta was denounced a terrorist and shot dead in broad daylight The events of Panighatta turned the tide of the agitation And what was once a peaceful protest now turned into a bloody warfare Another significant event of the Agitation was the massacre of th July On this day a peaceful protest was held at Main Road Kalimpong to challenge The Treaty of Nepal also known as Sugaulo Sandhi The treaty designed by the Indian government imposed restrictions on Gorkhas traveling to Nepal The peaceful protest turned into a bloodbath when the CRPF opened fire killing and injuring hundreds The incident also caught the eye of BBC who condemned the actions of the Indian government Whereas the government still continued to ignore the atrocities committed by CRPF According to the government record a total of Gorkhas were decimated And thousands were swept under the carpet To the day India will see us as their own To the day our people have their own identity and their land We are fighting not drowning Jai Gorkha Jai Gorkhaland Siddarth Kharga","Translated Title":"The Agitation of 1986 (The Untold stories of the Gorkhas)","GeoTopic Name":"British Indian Ocean Territory","GeoTopic Latitude":-6.0,"GeoTopic Longitude":72.0,"caption_generation":"a man and a woman sitting on a bench .","object_recognition":"['seashore, coast, seacoast, sea-coast', 'lakeside, lakeshore']","toxicity":0.0005877121,"severe_toxicity":0.0000016862,"obscene":0.0000450994,"identity_attack":0.0001537769,"insult":0.0001417279,"threat":0.0000142392,"sexual_explicit":0.0000171069},{"Dataset Index":7248,"Story Primary ID":72920,"Story ID":"STY1642624266","User Primary ID":6947,"User ID":"USR1623305567","Gender":"others","Age":13,"Title":"Cardi B offers to pay the burial costs for people killed in Bronx fire & other top stories","Narrative":"1.

The gravity of the crimes, inevitably, warranted investigation by country\u2019s premier investigating agency NIA.\r\nApart from NIA, Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also probing the PFI in multiple cases, including its role in the anti-CAA stir and the northeast Delhi riots, and a foreign funding case in 2018. ED is also probing alleged links between the PFI and Bhim Army and their role in funding unrest amongst the disadvantaged groups in north India. Recently, ED conducted nationwide raids on premises linked to the radical outfit, Popular Front of India (PFI), in connection with multiple cases of money laundering.\n The searches covered 26 locations across nine states, including premises associated with PFI Chairman O M Abdul Salam and national secretary Nasarudheen Elamaram. These are the cases being probed by the central agencies. State police of different states including Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala etc. are currently probing hundreds of cases against PFI and its sister organisations.\n\n\tContrary to the claim of PFI, the organisation has been found to be involved in a number of cases which are not only criminal in nature but also detrimental to the security and integrity of India. The Jharkhand government in 2019 banned the Popular Front of India (PFI) in the state. U.P and Karnataka are also in the process to put a ban on the radical outfit. After giving a serious thought the government has decided to ban PFI, as it has a nationwide footprint and therefore needs a nationwide action.\u00a0 The future of the nation will depend on the shoulders of those in power with a clear vision to safeguard the interests of the nation.\r\n","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166437804477861.png","Account Created Date":"2022-05-17 19:01:50","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-05-17","Interest":"Technology, History, Food, Entertainment, Sports, Environment, Science, Inequality, Education, Health, Politics, Economy, Climate change ","Sports Events":"South-East Asian Games, World Masters Games (Summer), IIHF World Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"Cannes Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":24.540001,"New COVID Cases":1829.0,"New Deaths":33.0,"New Vaccinations":1297045.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"The Witch TERRIFIES Simon Cowell to the CORE! | Auditions | BGT 2022","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Britain's Got Talent","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Views":16609383.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":198076.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Most recently horrendous communal crimes that shook the conscience of common man brutal beheading of an ordinary tailor named Kanhaiya Lal by two religious in bigots in Udaipur killing of Umesh Kolhe in Amaravati murder of BJP youth leader Praveen Nettaru in Karnataka arrest of martial arts trainer in Telangana and recovery of Vision document in Phulwari sherif Bihar all had one common connection i e the involvement of PFI The gravity of the crimes inevitably warranted investigation by country s premier investigating agency NIA Apart from NIA Enforcement Directorate ED is also probing the PFI in multiple cases including its role in the anti CAA stir and the northeast Delhi riots and a foreign funding case in ED is also probing alleged links between the PFI and Bhim Army and their role in funding unrest amongst the disadvantaged groups in north India Recently ED conducted nationwide raids on premises linked to the radical outfit Popular Front of India PFI in connection with multiple cases of money laundering The searches covered locations across nine states including premises associated with PFI Chairman O M Abdul Salam and national secretary Nasarudheen Elamaram These are the cases being probed by the central agencies State police of different states including Uttar Pradesh Karnataka Kerala etc are currently probing hundreds of cases against PFI and its sister organisations Contrary to the claim of PFI the organisation has been found to be involved in a number of cases which are not only criminal in nature but also detrimental to the security and integrity of India The Jharkhand government in banned the Popular Front of India PFI in the state U P and Karnataka are also in the process to put a ban on the radical outfit After giving a serious thought the government has decided to ban PFI as it has a nationwide footprint and therefore needs a nationwide action nbsp The future of the nation will depend on the shoulders of those in power with a clear vision to safeguard the interests of the nation ","Translated Title":"A Nationwide Ban on Popular Front of India.\n( Part-3)","GeoTopic Name":"British Indian Ocean Territory","GeoTopic Latitude":-6.0,"GeoTopic Longitude":72.0,"caption_generation":"a man in a suit and tie standing in a room .","object_recognition":"['fur coat', 'cardigan']","toxicity":0.009057382,"severe_toxicity":0.0000039538,"obscene":0.0002073961,"identity_attack":0.000863162,"insult":0.0010826436,"threat":0.0001727296,"sexual_explicit":0.0000735977},{"Dataset Index":51560,"Story Primary ID":118986,"Story ID":"STY1658765062","User Primary ID":29719,"User ID":"USR1648548882","Gender":"male","Age":18,"Title":"Arsenal technical director speaks up on new signings, Mikel Arteta and many more - PART 6","Narrative":"The Sky Sports reporter moved onto asking Edu what interaction he had with the owners on last Wednesday.\n\nHe replied: \"Not only with the spending because it's unfair to link the owners just with the spending.

The fascination of humans with keeping every animal they see in captivity is concerning and more likely than not, projection.

50th warframe Styanax","Narrative":"\u00a0Celebrating a milestone in Warframe, Digital Extreme is set to release its 50th Warframe. Name Styanax, it is set to arrive in September alongside the Veilbreaker update. When the update goes live, Styanax will be added to all player Arsenals for a limited time completely free. Described as a \u201cmighty and herculean\u201d Styanax is a Warframe whose design is inspired by the ancient Greek warrior Astyanax.\nHis abilities include the Axios Javelin - which can push back enemies on impact, causing damage if they hit a wall - and the Tharros Strike shield, capable of repelling enemies and reducing their shields and armour as it's swung around, regenerating Styanax's health with each successfully landed blow.\nFurthermore, Styanax can also use Rally Point which enables him to Draw enemy attention towards him. This also makes his own resolve uplift the resolve of nearby allies, regenerating their energy and shield, with shield regeneration increasing with the number of enemies near Styanax.\nLastly he has the ability of Final Stand which makes him exude might and valour, rise into the air and throw a barrage of Axios Javelins. The javelins in turn deal high damage to nearby enemies wherever they land with direct hits to enemies dealing even greater damage.\nApart from Styanax, the Veilbreaker update sees the return of fan-favourite New War character Kahl-175 in a new single-player quest. Here, players will be able to guide Kahl on a mission to investigate a Murex ship near Deimos and find the source of a mysterious signal, using powerful new abilities and tech to battle a Sentient army, as well as returning Archon boss enemies. Additionally, Kahl will playable in a series of new weekly co-op missions, enabling players to increase Kahl's rank upon completion and earn new customisations along the way.\nAnother major thing coming in September is a revamp of the existing Warframe Prime Vault program. While we don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s changing, we do know the rework is based on community feedback. Currently, there's no concrete release date for Veilbreaker, but it'll be hitting PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch simultaneously sometime in

Dopo la vittoria della Conference League, che ha riportato un trofeo europeo dopo oltre trent'anni, i giallorossi sono pronti a fare ancora di pi\u00f9. L'innesto di Dybala e la presentazione in grande stile ha esaltato l'ambiente e i giocatori e il partner d'attacco dell'argentino, quel Tammy Abraham che ha fatto benissimo la scorsa stagione, ora parla di scudetto.\n\n\"I tifosi romanisti sognano lo scudetto? \u00c8 giusto\", ha detto l'attaccante inglese, \"Quanto a me, se dicessi che non punto a conquistare lo scudetto racconterei una bugia. Lo voglio io, lo vuole la squadra. Ma per farlo, occorre che tutti mettiamo sul campo il massimo delle nostre potenzialit\u00e0. Poi faremo i conti: ho vinto l'anno scorso, come speravo, e voglio continuare a vincere\".\n\nSu Dybala tutto l'ambiente giallorosso ha solo parole di elogio. Stessa cosa Abraham: \"\u00c8 un privilegio per noi avere in squadra un giocatore di questo livello. Significa molto per i tifosi e significa moltissimo per noi, che stiamo costruendo un progetto tecnico di alto profilo. Se sono geloso? Ma no. Possono esserci due re, right?\".\n\nSi \u00e8 parlato tanto di un possibile ritorno in Premier League per Abraham. Non si sa quando e lui, a domanda, risponde senza esitazioni: \"Il primo giorno in cui sono arrivato alla Roma mi sono sentito a casa. Non ho fretta di tornare in Premier League perch\u00e9 qui posso esprimere il mio modo di giocare. In Italia mi sento felice sotto ogni aspetto. Se sono pentito di avere lasciato il Chelsea? Mai, nemmeno per un secondo. Scegliere la Roma \u00e8 stata una delle decisioni pi\u00f9 giuste che abbia preso in vita mia\".","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165911347154890.jpeg","Account Created Date":"2021-11-26 15:41:02","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-11-26","Interest":"abraham, roma, dybala","Sports Events":"World Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"French Film Festival, Made In Prague Festival, Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, International Documentary Festival Amsterdam","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_4","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1297.89,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":319.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":49.759998,"New COVID Cases":8318.0,"New Deaths":465.0,"New Vaccinations":12229439.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"$456,000 Squid Game In Real Life!","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"MrBeast","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Views":55419453.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":6284727.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"it","Title TikaDetect":"it","Narrative LangDetect":"it","Title LangDetect":"it","Translated Narrative":"In one year with Mourinho at the helm of the team, Roma have completely changed their objectives After the victory in the Conference League which brought back a European trophy after more than thirty years, the Giallorossi are ready to do even more The addition of Dybala and the big presentation style exalted the environment and the players and the Argentinian&#39;s attacking partner that Tammy Abraham who did very well last season is now talking about the Scudetto Roma fans dream of the right Scudetto said the English striker As for me if I said I don&#39;t aim to win I would tell a lie about the Scudetto I want it, the team wants it But to do that we all need to put our maximum potential on the field Then we&#39;ll do the math I won last year as I hoped and I want to keep winning On Dybala, the whole Giallorossi environment has only words of praise Same thing Abraham a privilege for us to have a player of this level in the team It means a lot to the fans and means a lot to us who are building a high profile technical project If I&#39;m jealous But no There can be two kings right We talked a lot of a possible return to the Premier League for Abraham It is not known when and he answers without hesitation when asked The first day I arrived at Roma I felt at home I am in no hurry to return to the Premier League because here I can express my playing In Italy I feel happy in every respect If I regret leaving Chelsea Never for a second Choosing Roma was one of the best decisions I&#39;ve made in my life","Translated Title":"Abraham punta su Dybala e sullo scudetto: \"I tifosi sognano?

Nella sua mente da pi\u00f9 di vent\u2019anni, l\u2019opera \u00e8 stata commissionata dall\u2019International Film Festival Rotterdam (IFFR) 2022 e proposta in anteprima assoluta in Pirelli HangarBicocca.\n \nCurata da Vicente Todol\u00ed, la mostra \u00e8 organizzata in collaborazione con Tate Modern, Londra, dove nel 2020 \u00e8 stata presentata una prima versione a cura di Clara Kim, The Daskalopoulous Senior Curator, International Art e Fiontan Moran, Assistant Curator, International Art.\n\nCurata da Vicente Todol\u00ed, \u201cSunshine State\u201d \u00e8 organizzata in collaborazione con Tate Modern, Londra, dove l\u2019artista aveva presentato una prima versione, dal titolo \u201cSteve McQueen\u201d, dal 13 febbraio al 6 settembre 2020. Per Pirelli HangarBicocca, McQueen ha concepito un apposito progetto espositivo e una nuova selezione di opere che si sviluppa negli spazi delle Navate e del Cubo e sull\u2019esterno dell\u2019edificio. Attraverso un percorso non cronologico, la mostra intende ripercorrere la carriera di Steve McQueen nelle arti visive, mettendo in luce l\u2019evoluzione della sua pratica degli ultimi vent\u2019anni.\nIl percorso espositivo si apre con Static (2009). Proiettate su un grande schermo, sospeso al centro della Piazza, si avvicendano in rapide sequenze riprese aeree della Statua della Libert\u00e0 di New York. Le disorientanti immagini ravvicinate del monumento ne mettono in discussione la funzione simbolica e colgono il senso di instabilit\u00e0 e precariet\u00e0 dell\u2019idea di libert\u00e0 individuale del mondo occidentale. Il film fa da contraltare al lavoro presentato nel Cubo e che chiude la mostra, Western Deep (2002). L\u2019opera conduce lo spettatore nelle profondit\u00e0 della miniera d\u2019oro di Tau Tona in Sudafrica, conosciuta durante l\u2019apartheid come \u201cWestern Deep\u201d, e offre un amaro spaccato delle dure condizioni lavorative dei minatori. Realizzate in pellicola Super-8, le riprese sgranate mostrano un\u2019ambientazione claustrofobica e buia che si contrappone a una visione pi\u00f9 aperta e allegorica del primo lavoro.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-164484652037264.jpeg","Account Created Date":"2021-11-09 14:31:49","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-11-09","Interest":"art, artist, arts, arte","Sports Events":"ICC World T20 (men)","Associated Film Festivals":"French Film Festival, Thessaloniki International Film Festival, European Film Forum SCANORAMA, London Korean Film Festival, Geneva International Film Festival, Cork International Film Festival, Made In Prague Festival, American Film Festival","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_4","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1297.89,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":319.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":54.82,"New COVID Cases":11466.0,"New Deaths":460.0,"New Vaccinations":3912102.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"ANUEL AA || BZRP Music Sessions #46","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Bizarrap","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Views":19537870.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1519609.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"it","Title TikaDetect":"it","Narrative LangDetect":"it","Title LangDetect":"it","Translated Narrative":"From March to July, Pirelli HangarBicocca presents the Sunshine State exhibition dedicated to Steve McQueen, the artist and filmmaker who won the Turner Prize and the Academy Award.

In an interview about Thor: Love and and Thunder, when asked if this was his final Marvel Cinematic Universe film, he said he doesn't know. When asked if he wants to play the role again, he responded by declaring his love for the role. He said he loves it so much that he wants to do it again unless someone forces him not to. \n\nThis came as a huge relief to Thor's fans.

Having laid all its cards on the table in an opening scene designed to jog your memory, the film hurtles towards an equally bonkers plot twist of its own.\nThis isn\u2019t to say that the movie surrounding the shock reveal (which arrives midway through its brisk 90-minute runtime) is any good. First Kill is a loosely written horror-thriller that is more camp than its self-serious predecessor, but is simultaneously not camp enough for the sort of lunacy that it wants us to participate in.\nIsabelle Fuhrman, who plays Esther, was around 10 years old when she filmed the first Orphan, which remains director Jaume Collet-Serra\u2019s finest film, despite the significant progress that he has since made in his career. For her to play a child her own age was one thing, but her physical performance in the film\u2019s post-twist section, as an adult trapped in a girl\u2019s body, was unsettlingly phenomenal. In First Kill, the now 25-year-old Fuhrman is closer in age to the psychopathic adult \u2018Esther\u2019. The challenge for her, this time around, was to play an eight-year-old convincingly. It\u2019s a performance within a performance, almost like \u2014 stay with me here \u2014 Benedict Cumberbatch in\u00a0The Power of the Dog. But it will likely not be recognised beyond horror movie circles, because \u2014 and Emily Blunt and Thomas Jane would know this better than anybody else \u2014 that\u2019s what happens to great dramatic performances in genre films. A special mention, regardless, is owed to Julia Stiles. She goes toe-to-toe with Fuhrman, but revealing more about her character would be inappropriate.\nRead the full article here: https:\/\/indianexpress.com\/article\/entertainment\/movie-review\/orphan-first-kill-movie-review-isabelle-furhman-horror-film-8108986\/\n","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166151483916615.png","Account Created Date":"2022-07-26 18:00:42","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-07-26","Interest":"Technology, History, Food, Entertainment, Sports, Environment, Science, Inequality, Education, Health, Politics, Economy, Climate change ","Sports Events":"World Police and Fire Games, Tour de France Femmes","Associated Film Festivals":"Melbourne Documentary Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_3","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1128.48,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":363.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":9.63,"New COVID Cases":18313.0,"New Deaths":57.0,"New Vaccinations":3180012.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"100 Girls Vs 100 Boys For $500,000","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"MrBeast","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Views":27019105.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1680104.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Orphan First Kill movie review Crazy sequel to cult horror classic isn t crazy enough The first Orphan film released in to mediocre reviews but readymade for cult status had a twist so deliciously depraved that revealing it here in a review of the sequel prequel would be cruel But Orphan First Kill the surprise second instalment released years after the first but set two years before it lets you in on the secret from minute one Having laid all its cards on the table in an opening scene designed to jog your memory the film hurtles towards an equally bonkers plot twist of its own This isn t to say that the movie surrounding the shock reveal which arrives midway through its brisk minute runtime is any good First Kill is a loosely written horror thriller that is more camp than its self serious predecessor but is simultaneously not camp enough for the sort of lunacy that it wants us to participate in Isabelle Fuhrman who plays Esther was around years old when she filmed the first Orphan which remains director Jaume Collet Serra s finest film despite the significant progress that he has since made in his career For her to play a child her own age was one thing but her physical performance in the film s post twist section as an adult trapped in a girl s body was unsettlingly phenomenal In First Kill the now year old Fuhrman is closer in age to the psychopathic adult Esther The challenge for her this time around was to play an eight year old convincingly It s a performance within a performance almost like stay with me here Benedict Cumberbatch in The Power of the Dog But it will likely not be recognised beyond horror movie circles because and Emily Blunt and Thomas Jane would know this better than anybody else that s what happens to great dramatic performances in genre films A special mention regardless is owed to Julia Stiles She goes toe to toe with Fuhrman but revealing more about her character would be inappropriate Read the full article here ","Translated Title":"Orphan First Kill movie review: Crazy sequel to cult horror classic isn\u2019t crazy enough","GeoTopic Name":null,"GeoTopic Latitude":null,"GeoTopic Longitude":null,"caption_generation":"a collage of pictures of different scenes of different colors .","object_recognition":"['coucal', 'howler monkey, howler']","toxicity":0.007968084,"severe_toxicity":0.000209056,"obscene":0.0008369232,"identity_attack":0.0010711842,"insult":0.0026855487,"threat":0.0008960561,"sexual_explicit":0.000330716},{"Dataset Index":32355,"Story Primary ID":122472,"Story ID":"STY1659781919","User Primary ID":23337,"User ID":"USR1642518229","Gender":"male","Age":39,"Title":"Tennis, sorteggio pessimo a Montreal per Sinner e Berrettini","Narrative":"Non sorride il sorteggio del Master ATP di Montreal ai colori azzurri, soprattutto per Sinner e Berrettini, i quali hanno bisogno di fare pi\u00f9 strada possibile per recuperare una classifica penalizzante a causa di infortuni e dei punti non assegnati a Wimbledon.

Hag","Narrative":"So Erik Ten Hag joins Manchester United. After much deliberation between Erik Ten Hag and Paris Saint Germain coach Mauricio Pochettino, the board decided to go with the ex-Ajax boss, who concluded this season by winning 3 Eredivisie champions 3 times in 4 years. Man United also had a change in management with chief executive Edward Woodward stepping down, and he was replaced with Richard Arnold. John Murtough has been bought as director of football for Man Utd. Mitchell Van Der Gaarg joins the boss as his assistant. United also managed to bring in Steve McLaren to join United as a coach. Man United interim manager Ralf Rangnick bought on to steady the ship after the Glazers fired Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but could not do much as United are poised to finish in sixth place and well out of the Champions League spot. The Red Devils were unable to adapt to his high pressing style, also known as \u2018gegenpressing\u2019. However, Ralf had jotted down players as there will be a massive exodus this summer. The likes of Paul Pogba, Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic are expected to leave. Plus there are players who were not up to the mark and are also expected to be sold.\u00a0\n\n\nThe boss has been given a transfer kitty of 150 million, which could rise to 200 million after sales of underperforming players. He has a list of players he wants to bring with him to Old Trafford and start a new era.\u00a0\nDefence\n\n\nUnited defence has been worrying. The United trio of Victor Lindelof, Raphael Varane and Captain Harry Maguire have looked out of place. Man United conceded a shocking 56 goals this season, which has forced the board to look at the defensive reinforcements for the new manager.\u00a0","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165304636477172.png","Account Created Date":"2022-01-26 08:38:16","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-01-26","Interest":"manchester united, erik ten hag, football, Sports, transfer, analysis, cristiano ronaldo","Sports Events":"Africa Cup of Nations, Australian Open","Associated Film Festivals":"Sundance Film Festival 2022, International Film Festival Rotterdam 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1062.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":332.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":28.629999,"New COVID Cases":286384.0,"New Deaths":573.0,"New Vaccinations":5871190.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Marvel Studios\u2019 Moon Knight | Official Trailer | Disney+","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Marvel Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Views":26619026.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1077760.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"de","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"de","Translated Narrative":"So Erik Ten Hag joins Manchester United After much deliberation between Erik Ten Hag and Paris Saint Germain coach Mauricio Pochettino the board decided to go with the ex Ajax boss who concluded this season by winning Eredivisie champions times in years Man United also had a change in management with chief executive Edward Woodward stepping down and he was replaced with Richard Arnold John Murtough has been bought as director of football for Man Utd Mitchell Van Der Gaarg joins the boss as his assistant United also managed to bring in Steve McLaren to join United as a coach Man United interim manager Ralf Rangnick bought on to steady the ship after the Glazers fired Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but could not do much as United are poised to finish in sixth place and well out of the Champions League spot The Red Devils were unable to adapt to his high pressing style also known as gegenpressing However Ralf had jotted down players as there will be a massive exodus this summer The likes of Paul Pogba Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic are expected to leave Plus there are players who were not up to the mark and are also expected to be sold The boss has been given a transfer kitty of million which could rise to million after sales of underperforming players He has a list of players he wants to bring with him to Old Trafford and start a new era Defence United defence has been worrying The United trio of Victor Lindelof Raphael Varane and Captain Harry Maguire have looked out of place Man United conceded a shocking goals this season which has forced the board to look at the defensive reinforcements for the new manager ","Translated Title":"Manchester United -

The Godfather Egg losses its power and THERE COMES ALL THE BLOOD. \nThis bloodhed comes in the form of your period. \ud83e\ude78\ud83e\ude78\ud83e\ude78 \nOkay, but that's what a period is. What does this have to do with PCOS? \nSo, in PCOS, the Godfather Egg is never formed. It's just those tiny little egg gangsters fighting amongst themselves to become the Godfather, but of course, nothing really happens. Your body kepps growing multiple eggs, but none of them become big enough to become the main egg.\nNow if there are so many little gangsters constantly fighting, peace and prosperity in the ovary locality is obviously disturbed. This causes all your symptoms from PCOS.\nIt's all these little eggs that end up looking like \"cysts\" on an ultrasound... hencez 'poly' (many) 'cystic' (cyst like) ovarian syndrome... \nAnd that's our Godfather PCOS story! \u2728","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166383568125288.png","Account Created Date":"2022-07-20 11:03:13","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-07-20","Interest":"Science, Education, Health, pcos, pcod, womenhealth","Sports Events":"Tour de France, IAAF World Championships, Summer X Games","Associated Film Festivals":"Melbourne Documentary Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_3","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1128.48,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":363.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":15.51,"New COVID Cases":23050.0,"New Deaths":45.0,"New Vaccinations":2796737.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"ITZY \u201cSNEAKERS\u201d M\/V @ITZY","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"JYP Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Music","YouTube Trending Video Views":66327085.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1562455.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"What s the deal with PCOS PCOS formerly known as PCOD is a condition in your ovaries Your ovaries are like the egg basket of your body You know how your fridge has a little tray for eggs Yeah your ovaries are kinda like the fridge egg drawer of your body Okay so whatever but like what happens in it Well your ovaries are prime real estate Think of it like a really prime peice of land that all the land mafia want to grab and dominate over The ovary locality is full of baby eggs These baby eggs all grow together to become little egg gangsters So all these tiny little egg gangsters keep fighting amongst themselves to become victorious and claim all that prime land Only one become the Godfather Egg So like every area has on prime mobster so does your ovary Every month all these little egg gangs fight with each other to become Godfather Egg of the area for that month This Godfather is the one that ovulates every month if it can manage to secure a meeting with prince sperm then they can make a baby If the Godfather Egg can t manage to get a meeting with precious prince sperm there is Well there is bloodshed The Godfather Egg losses its power and THERE COMES ALL THE BLOOD This bloodhed comes in the form of your period Okay but that s what a period is What does this have to do with PCOS So in PCOS the Godfather Egg is never formed It s just those tiny little egg gangsters fighting amongst themselves to become the Godfather but of course nothing really happens Your body kepps growing multiple eggs but none of them become big enough to become the main egg Now if there are so many little gangsters constantly fighting peace and prosperity in the ovary locality is obviously disturbed This causes all your symptoms from PCOS It s all these little eggs that end up looking like cysts on an ultrasound hencez poly many cystic cyst like ovarian syndrome And that s our Godfather PCOS story ","Translated Title":"What's the deal with PCOS? \ud83e\udd28","GeoTopic Name":null,"GeoTopic Latitude":null,"GeoTopic Longitude":null,"caption_generation":"a crowd of people standing on top of a street .","object_recognition":"['web site, website, internet site, site', 'envelope']","toxicity":0.0006995575,"severe_toxicity":0.0000010162,"obscene":0.0000280793,"identity_attack":0.0000880842,"insult":0.0001695305,"threat":0.0000274432,"sexual_explicit":0.0000069419},{"Dataset Index":32758,"Story Primary ID":85130,"Story ID":"STY1646388498","User Primary ID":23337,"User ID":"USR1642518229","Gender":"male","Age":40,"Title":"Il campione del mondo dei pesi massimi Usyk si arruola per l'Ucraina.","Narrative":"Non ci sar\u00e0 alcuna rivincita per la cintura mondiale con il britannico Joshua, almeno per ora.

According to \"The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2022\", 656.7 million people would be living on less than $1.90 per day worldwide in 2022. However, increasing food costs and the broader consequences of Russia's invasion of Ukraine might increase that figure to 676.5 million, Kyodo News reported.    Furthermore, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated in the report that the conflict in Ukraine has \"caused food, fuel, and fertiliser prices to skyrocket\". Additionally, the UN chief claimed that it would also disrupt \u201csupply chains and global trade and cause distress in financial markets.\"   According to the Kyodo News report, even though the projection is still below 684.2 million in 2021, the Russian invasion, which commenced in late February, would put the globe \"even further from meeting the target of ending extreme poverty by 2030\", one of the 17 SDGs. \n\nThe UN report further highlighted the fact that worries over food security have increased recently, particularly in countries like Africa and the Middle East that are heavily reliant on grain from Ukraine, a significant producer. As per the report, at least 50 countries import nearly 30% of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine. Notably, Ukrainian and Russian wheat makes up more than half of the wheat consumed in several African and least developed nations.\n\nDue to the war, a staggering 100 million people are believed to have been forcefully uprooted from their houses as of May, with nearly 6.5 million of them fleeing Ukraine, according to the report.\n\nJapan, the United States, and other Group of Seven nations have chastised Russia for obstructing the Black Sea ports of Ukraine and damaging its agricultural infrastructure, which has prevented products from being exported globally. Meanwhile, Russia, a major exporter of grains and one of the world's top producers of crude oil, has attributed food shortages and soaring food and energy costs on G-7-led economic sanctions against Moscow.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166070061291137.png","Account Created Date":"2022-07-04 07:07:01","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-07-04","Interest":"russia, ukraine invasion","Sports Events":"Wimbledon, Women's FIH Hockey World Cup, Tour de France","Associated Film Festivals":"Doc Edge 2022, Melbourne Documentary Film Festival 2022, Karlovy Vary International Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_3","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1128.48,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":363.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":13.17,"New COVID Cases":13086.0,"New Deaths":19.0,"New Vaccinations":367111.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"so long nerds","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Technoblade","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Gaming","YouTube Trending Video Views":53135626.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":6541821.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"The United Nations recently revealed in its latest report that the unfavourable repercussions of the Russia Ukraine war such as increased food prices might force over million more people into severe poverty this year According to The Sustainable Development Goals Report million people would be living on less than per day worldwide in However increasing food costs and the broader consequences of Russia s invasion of Ukraine might increase that figure to million Kyodo News reported Furthermore UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres stated in the report that the conflict in Ukraine has caused food fuel and fertiliser prices to skyrocket Additionally the UN chief claimed that it would also disrupt supply chains and global trade and cause distress in financial markets According to the Kyodo News report even though the projection is still below million in the Russian invasion which commenced in late February would put the globe even further from meeting the target of ending extreme poverty by one of the SDGs The UN report further highlighted the fact that worries over food security have increased recently particularly in countries like Africa and the Middle East that are heavily reliant on grain from Ukraine a significant producer As per the report at least countries import nearly of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine Notably Ukrainian and Russian wheat makes up more than half of the wheat consumed in several African and least developed nations Due to the war a staggering million people are believed to have been forcefully uprooted from their houses as of May with nearly million of them fleeing Ukraine according to the report Japan the United States and other Group of Seven nations have chastised Russia for obstructing the Black Sea ports of Ukraine and damaging its agricultural infrastructure which has prevented products from being exported globally Meanwhile Russia a major exporter of grains and one of the world s top producers of crude oil has attributed food shortages and soaring food and energy costs on G led economic sanctions against Moscow ","Translated Title":"How the Russia Ukraine war is hurting people","GeoTopic Name":"Russian Federation","GeoTopic Latitude":60.0,"GeoTopic Longitude":100.0,"caption_generation":"a man is holding a pair of scissors","object_recognition":"['plastic bag', 'shower cap']","toxicity":0.0003503136,"severe_toxicity":0.0000013799,"obscene":0.0000277418,"identity_attack":0.0000730822,"insult":0.0000996114,"threat":0.0000183006,"sexual_explicit":0.0000125451},{"Dataset Index":31517,"Story Primary ID":98059,"Story ID":"STY1651509614","User Primary ID":22890,"User ID":"USR1642432836","Gender":null,"Age":21,"Title":"Tatuami Tattoo Convention - 14 e 15 maggio - Hotel Crowne Plaza Milan Linate","Narrative":"Torna, dopo la pausa forzata a causa della pandemia, \u00a0la Tatuami Tattoo Convention, la manifestazione per tutti gli appassionati dell\u2019arte del tatuaggio che si daranno appuntamento sabato 14 e domenica 15 maggio nei saloni dell'Hotel Crowne Plaza Milan Linate a San Donato Milanese.\u00a0\nUn \u00a0grande show che si rinnova ogni anno e che chiama a raccolta in ogni sua edizione, migliaia di visitatori che si ritrovano alla Tatuami per farsi tatuare dal proprio artista preferito o anche semplicemente per curiosare fra le centinaia di stand.

This was a big blow for the hosts as they have already been placed in a very difficult Group alongside USA, Brazil and Morocco. During the post-match press conference, India\u2019s manager Thomas Dennerby opened up about some big mistakes that they committed during the match. \nFor instance, he was surprised by how easily some of the USA corners totally opened their defence up. \u201cThe funny thing is that for a very very long time, we did not let any goal in from almost any set piece at all. We have been defending very very well, but of course, we have not played against any team with top-quality players like this who has 6ft height, also jumping very high and heading with top-class quality. Honestly, I was a little bit surprised because we used to be very sharp in set pieces. But of course, that was not the case today.\u201d\nThe gaffer also cited nervousness as one of the many reasons for their loss tonight. \u201cI know that team India can play a little bit better than this. My feeling from the side was that girls were little bit too nervous. Couldn't really handle the pressure of playing their first world cup. So in the beginning we didn't even try to pass the ball to each other, we were just defending and sending it away, not comfortable enough. I was shouting from the sideline \u2018Start playing, start playing!\u2019 and the first time we tried to build up, we lost the ball and that was 3-0\u201d. \nOn being asked whether this was his biggest-ever defeat, he replied that he hadn\u2019t lost a game by 8-0 margin in a championship match before. He said that he did not expect India to let so many goals in before adding that even against Sweden a week ago we defended very well.\n","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-16655556952985.png","Account Created Date":"2022-10-12 10:28:08","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-10-12","Interest":"football, fifau17womensworldcup, fifa, india, usa, thomasdennerby","Sports Events":"World Volleyball Championships (women), South American Games, Womens World Cup, World Track Championships","Associated Film Festivals":"New York Film Festival 2022, BFI London Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_4","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1299.74,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":377.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":10.51,"New COVID Cases":5084.0,"New Deaths":12.0,"New Vaccinations":817198.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"BLACKPINK - \u2018Shut Down\u2019 M\/V","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"BLACKPINK","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Music","YouTube Trending Video Views":174483909.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":8371243.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Team India suffered a humiliating defeat against the USA in their opening match of the FIFA U Women s World Cup This was a big blow for the hosts as they have already been placed in a very difficult Group alongside USA Brazil and Morocco During the post match press conference India s manager Thomas Dennerby opened up about some big mistakes that they committed during the match For instance he was surprised by how easily some of the USA corners totally opened their defence up The funny thing is that for a very very long time we did not let any goal in from almost any set piece at all We have been defending very very well but of course we have not played against any team with top quality players like this who has ft height also jumping very high and heading with top class quality Honestly I was a little bit surprised because we used to be very sharp in set pieces But of course that was not the case today The gaffer also cited nervousness as one of the many reasons for their loss tonight I know that team India can play a little bit better than this My feeling from the side was that girls were little bit too nervous Couldn t really handle the pressure of playing their first world cup So in the beginning we didn t even try to pass the ball to each other we were just defending and sending it away not comfortable enough I was shouting from the sideline Start playing start playing and the first time we tried to build up we lost the ball and that was On being asked whether this was his biggest ever defeat he replied that he hadn t lost a game by margin in a championship match before He said that he did not expect India to let so many goals in before adding that even against Sweden a week ago we defended very well ","Translated Title":"\"We used to be good in defending corners\" - Dennerby surprised with team conceding corners","GeoTopic Name":"British Indian Ocean Territory","GeoTopic Latitude":-6.0,"GeoTopic Longitude":72.0,"caption_generation":"a man in a suit and tie standing in a room .","object_recognition":"['ballpoint, ballpoint pen, ballpen, Biro', 'nail']","toxicity":0.0110317609,"severe_toxicity":0.0000390022,"obscene":0.0019900515,"identity_attack":0.0014647469,"insult":0.0035749442,"threat":0.0004008075,"sexual_explicit":0.0030185602},{"Dataset Index":23013,"Story Primary ID":134643,"Story ID":"STY1661795196","User Primary ID":12288,"User ID":"USR1638809306","Gender":"male","Age":21,"Title":"Paris Saint-Germain reach verbal agreement with Jackie Groenen amid United's resistance to sell","Narrative":"Paris Saint-Germain are reportedly interested in signing Manchester United midfielder Jackie Groenen. According to Anthony Rech of RMC Sport, Paris Saint-Germain and Dutch midfield maestro Jackie Groenen have reached an agreement. The report also mentions that Groenen wants to join the French giants. Manchester United are in no mood to sell Jackie. \nJackie Groenen became Manchester United\u2019s first non-British women\u2019s player back in 2019 when she joined the side from Eintracht Frankfurt. A key player for the Red Devils, Jackie\u2019s presence in that midfield is a driving force for the team which has earned her the nickname \u2018THE SYSTEM\u2019. \nThe 2017 UEFA European Championship winner was linked to Juventus two months back after the Bianconeri\u2019s failed attempt in signing the Oranje international in 2018. \nIn June, Tutto Mercato journalist Mirko Di Natale reported that Groenen had signed a new contract at Manchester United till 2024. Jackie\u2019s United contract was set to expire on 30th June 2020 but United activated the one year extension option in her contract. \nWith a year left on Jackie\u2019s contract, in the event of a transfer happening, PSG will have to pay a hefty transfer fee to Manchester United for the signature of the Dutch international. Any attempts from the Les Parisiennes will be met with resistance from United's side at this point of time as Marc Skinner\u2019s side are in the final stages of their preparation for the new season. Manchester United will be facing rivals Tottenham Hotspur on 10th September at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in the Women\u2019s Super League.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166179484721058.png","Account Created Date":"2021-12-06 22:18:26","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-12-06","Interest":"Sports, manchester united women, women's football, muwfc","Sports Events":"World Championships (women)","Associated Film Festivals":"French Film Festival, Made In Prague Festival, Red Sea Film Festival","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_4","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1297.89,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":319.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":47.919998,"New COVID Cases":6822.0,"New Deaths":220.0,"New Vaccinations":4954505.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME - Official Trailer (HD)","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Sony Pictures Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Views":52791730.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":2603462.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Paris Saint Germain are reportedly interested in signing Manchester United midfielder Jackie Groenen According to Anthony Rech of RMC Sport Paris Saint Germain and Dutch midfield maestro Jackie Groenen have reached an agreement The report also mentions that Groenen wants to join the French giants Manchester United are in no mood to sell Jackie Jackie Groenen became Manchester United s first non British women s player back in when she joined the side from Eintracht Frankfurt A key player for the Red Devils Jackie s presence in that midfield is a driving force for the team which has earned her the nickname THE SYSTEM The UEFA European Championship winner was linked to Juventus two months back after the Bianconeri s failed attempt in signing the Oranje international in In June Tutto Mercato journalist Mirko Di Natale reported that Groenen had signed a new contract at Manchester United till Jackie s United contract was set to expire on th June but United activated the one year extension option in her contract With a year left on Jackie s contract in the event of a transfer happening PSG will have to pay a hefty transfer fee to Manchester United for the signature of the Dutch international Any attempts from the Les Parisiennes will be met with resistance from United s side at this point of time as Marc Skinner s side are in the final stages of their preparation for the new season Manchester United will be facing rivals Tottenham Hotspur on th September at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in the Women s Super League ","Translated Title":"Paris Saint-Germain reach verbal agreement with Jackie Groenen amid United's resistance to sell","GeoTopic Name":"Manchester","GeoTopic Latitude":53.41667,"GeoTopic Longitude":-2.25,"caption_generation":"a man holding a white frisbee in his hands .","object_recognition":"['soccer ball', 'rugby ball']","toxicity":0.0015457894,"severe_toxicity":0.0000069112,"obscene":0.0000720462,"identity_attack":0.0004868207,"insult":0.0004887049,"threat":0.0000655075,"sexual_explicit":0.0001543987},{"Dataset Index":25574,"Story Primary ID":124128,"Story ID":"STY1660091375","User Primary ID":40936,"User ID":"USR1654102043","Gender":"female","Age":19,"Title":"Taylor Swift declines the copyright infringement over the song \"Shake it off\"","Narrative":"Taylor Swift has denied any copyright infringement over her hit 2014 song \u201cShake it Off,\u201d writing in a federal court document filed on Monday that \u201cthe lyrics to \u2018Shake It Off\u2019 were written entirely by me.\u201d\n\nSwift was first sued over the song in 2017 by songwriters Sean Hall and Nathan Butler, who claimed she took lyrics from their 2001 song \u201cPlayas Gon\u2019 Play\u201d by 3LW.

Almeno dal punto di vista del punteggio la Juventus pu\u00f2 festeggiare un inizio di campionato che l'ha vista trionfare con un secco 3-0 sul Sassuolo. Peccato per gli infortuni, soprattutto quello di Di Maria, decisamente il migliore in campo insieme a Vlahovic. I due hanno gi\u00e0 trovato una bella sintonia e marted\u00ec si capir\u00e0 l'entit\u00e0 dell'infortunio dell'argentino.\n\nCon due gol nel primo tempo e uno nella ripresa i bianconeri liquidano una pratica che, sulla carta, non sembrava essere cos\u00ec scontata. Il Sassuolo \u00e8 da sempre una \"ammazza grandi\" ma questa volta, complice anche l'assenza di tanti giocatori tra cessioni e trattative in corso (Raspadori), i neroverdi non hanno fatto altro che soccombere sotto le giocate avversarie. Anche se nei primi 25 minuti avevano anche giocato meglio spaventando Perin in pi\u00f9 di un'occasione.\n\nIl gol di Di Maria al 26' ha spezzato gli equilibri. Il primo gol italiano per l'ex Real Madrid, Psg e Manchester United d\u00e0 il \"la\" alla Juventus che prende in mano il gioco e, tra la fine del primo tempo e l'inizio del secondo, va altre due volte in rete con Vlahovic: il primo su calcio di rigore e il secondo su assist proprio di Di Maria che sfrutta al meglio un disimpegno sbagliato del Sassuolo.\n\nJuventus-Sassuolo 3-0\n\nReti: 26' Di Maria, 43' rig. Vlahovic, 51' Vlahovic\n\nJuventus (4-4-2): Perin; Danilo, Bonucci, Bremer, Alex Sandro (61' De Sciglio); Cuadrado (61' Kostic), Zakaria, Locatelli (76' Rovella), McKennie (76' Soul\u00e9); Di Maria (66' Miretti), Vlahovic. All.

The Argentine goalkeeper is interested in returning to his former club, where he spent a couple of seasons. Manchester United fans also have a soft corner for the former keeper, and would be more than happy to see him back in United colours. \n\nAs reported by Manchester Evening News, Sergio Romero is inclined towards a move to Manchester United, despite no formal interest being shown by the club. Dean Henderson could potentially leave the club on loan, which has left Erik ten Hag searching for a reserve keeper.\n\nSergio Romero did not leave Manchester United under the best of circumstances last year. His last appearance came in the Europa League quarter finals in the 2019-20 season. His relationship with former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was strained, as the latter made him train alone in his last season. \n\nSergio Romero is a free agent, after spending a season with Italian side Venezia. The club has been relegated to the second division after marking its return to the top flight.\n\nIn his last season at Old Trafford, Romero did not make a single appearance in the league or in any of the cup ties. It can be said that the goalkeeper was dished out harsh treatment by the club. Despite what has been happened in the past, Sergio Romero can be termed as kind of a fans\u2019 favourite at Old Trafford.\n\nDavid de Gea will undoubtedly be United\u2019s number one choice goalkeeper for the next season. The Spaniard answered his critics last year, after delivering several match winning performances.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165659653121275.png","Account Created Date":"2022-01-05 19:03:47","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-01-05","Interest":"manchester united","Sports Events":null,"Associated Film Festivals":null,"Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1062.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":332.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":41.330002,"New COVID Cases":90928.0,"New Deaths":325.0,"New Vaccinations":9873694.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"We Don't Talk About Bruno (From Encanto)","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"DisneyMusicVEVO","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Music","YouTube Trending Video Views":33862057.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":662622.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Sergio Romero is among the potential candidates to return to Old Trafford this summer The Argentine goalkeeper is interested in returning to his former club where he spent a couple of seasons Manchester United fans also have a soft corner for the former keeper and would be more than happy to see him back in United colours As reported by Manchester Evening News Sergio Romero is inclined towards a move to Manchester United despite no formal interest being shown by the club Dean Henderson could potentially leave the club on loan which has left Erik ten Hag searching for a reserve keeper Sergio Romero did not leave Manchester United under the best of circumstances last year His last appearance came in the Europa League quarter finals in the season His relationship with former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was strained as the latter made him train alone in his last season Sergio Romero is a free agent after spending a season with Italian side Venezia The club has been relegated to the second division after marking its return to the top flight In his last season at Old Trafford Romero did not make a single appearance in the league or in any of the cup ties It can be said that the goalkeeper was dished out harsh treatment by the club Despite what has been happened in the past Sergio Romero can be termed as kind of a fans favourite at Old Trafford David de Gea will undoubtedly be United s number one choice goalkeeper for the next season The Spaniard answered his critics last year after delivering several match winning performances ","Translated Title":"Sergio Romero could make a return to Manchester United this summer","GeoTopic Name":"Manchester","GeoTopic Latitude":53.41667,"GeoTopic Longitude":-2.25,"caption_generation":"a group of people standing next to each other .","object_recognition":"['theater curtain, theatre curtain', 'altar']","toxicity":0.000445512,"severe_toxicity":0.000001437,"obscene":0.0000371649,"identity_attack":0.0001012623,"insult":0.0001229786,"threat":0.0000156006,"sexual_explicit":0.0000136783},{"Dataset Index":62365,"Story Primary ID":105861,"Story ID":"STY1654696505","User Primary ID":41111,"User ID":"USR1654164580","Gender":null,"Age":20,"Title":"What is home?","Narrative":"For me, home is not just a house.

Hindus all around the world will be celebrating Janmashtami from today till tomorrow. \n\nIt is widely celebrated  in the cities of Mathura and Vrindavan, where Krishna is believed to have been born and spent his growing-up years. \n\nFor the followers of Lord Krishna, Janmashtami is the most important festival which usually celebrated by keeping fast and performing pooja.\n\nJanmashtami 2022 will be marked on the eighth day of the dark fortnight in the month of Bhadrapada (July-August) in India. This year, there has been a lot of confusion about whether Krishna Janmashtami will be celebrated on August 18 or August 19.\n\nAs per the Hindu Mythology, Lord Krishna, the human incarnation of Vishnu, was born on this day to destroy Mathura\u2019s demon King, Kansa. He was the brother of Krishna\u2019s virtuous brother Devaki.\n\nKrishna was born on the eighth day of the dark fortnight in the Bhadrapada month (August-September) in Mathura and was Devaki and Vasudeva\u2019s son.\n\nLord Krishna loved curd, white butter, and milk during his childhood days.

For the FIFA World Cup 2022, multiple cameras are in the stadium to just track the coordinates of the players. A sensor is also fitted into the ball to adjudge a potential offside. A few years and a decade ago, it was not at the stage that it is today with the help of Artificial Intelligence. In this article, we shall look at VAR and how it actually works across the globe.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat is VAR (Virtual Assistant Referee)?\n\nVirtual Assistant Referee (VAR) is a set of three to five referees in a separate operating room helping the referee on the pitch to make an informed decision. These referees are along with a replay operator who goes through the video of relevant occurrences.\u00a0\n\n\nVirtual Assistant Referee is used to concluding four different instances. Goals, violations of rules while proceeding to goals, red cards and mistaken players while awarding a card and penalty calls. With the help of videos from these instances, referees can overturn the decision in case it is a mistake. However, to overturn the decision, there should be clear evidence.\n\n\nHow does VAR work?\n\nThere are two ways how the VAR (Virtual Assistant Referee) can work:\nOn-pitch referee asking for suggestions: When an incident has occurred on the pitch, the referee may take a call to review the decision with VAR as he is doubtful of what happened.\u00a0\n\nVAR suggesting the on-field referee: On certain occasions, VAR can suggest the referee take a close call on a certain decision by taking a closer look at the on-field TV.\u00a0\n\nWhat is the time to overturn the decision?\u00a0\nOn certain occasions, fans might not be aware of the going on VAR review. However, once the ball goes out of play, the on-field referee will receive the instructions to stop the play if the review is happening. However, if the game gets restarted and play goes on, the decision can't be overturned.\u00a0","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165705360880552.png","Account Created Date":"2022-03-01 19:51:35","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-03-01","Interest":"football, var, fifa world cup, qatar","Sports Events":"Six Nations","Associated Film Festivals":null,"Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1062.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":332.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":37.84,"New COVID Cases":7554.0,"New Deaths":223.0,"New Vaccinations":1495732.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J.

But it cannot be ignored that like most abrahamic religions, it has been relentlessly cruel to fellow christians and non christians. And no, I'm not talking only about how a vast majority of its expansion happened through violence, colonization and persecution \u2013 which makes it one of the most violent religions in the world \u2013 but also what's written in the scriptures.\n\nAngels will cast anyone who does not follow God into the fire (Matthew 13, 41\u201342).\n\nJesus did not come to bring harmony, but division, according to Luke 12:51\u201353.\n\nActs 5, 1\u201310: God terrorises a couple for keeping some money after selling their land.\n\nThose who are haughty or boastful, or who defy parents, homosexuals and others are all worthy of death, according to Romans 1, 24\u201332. People who do not do these acts but support those who do are also guilty.\n\nGod will send severe delusions so that we will not believe and will be doomed, according to II Thessalonians 2, 11\u201312.\n\nOnly death may bring forgiveness, according to Hebrews 9:13\u201322.\n\nI Peter 3:20: God wiped out the world with a flood, except for eight people. Noah and the ark aren't merely found in the Old Testament.\n\nRevelation 4:11 says that God created everything for his own enjoyment. Hurricanes, tsunamis, volcanoes, parasites, illnesses, cancer, and AIDS are just a few examples of what he created merely for his enjoyment. Everything was created by God and for God's delight.\n\nGod's chosen are predestined (Ephesians 1, 4\u20135 & 11). There is no such thing as free will. There is no way to make amends. Before the world was created, your fate was decided. Your doom or salvation was decided long before you were born.\n\n\n[ https:\/\/users.drew.edu\/~jlenz\/whynot.html ]","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165498971884761.png","Account Created Date":"2022-03-14 22:18:23","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-03-14","Interest":"religion","Sports Events":"Six Nations, ODI World Cup for women","Associated Film Festivals":"SXSW 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1062.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":332.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":28.0,"New COVID Cases":2568.0,"New Deaths":97.0,"New Vaccinations":1795410.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J.

Mistakes that got it\u00a0here","Narrative":"Illegal and unregulated artisanal gold mining on the Witwatersrand Basin, located south of South Africa\u2019s Gauteng province, is an increasing threat to community, industrial and state security. Reports on turf wars between rival gangs, or shootouts between illegal miners and security officers are commonplace.\n\nBut recent incidents point to a spike in the scale of illegal activity, conflict and criminality.\n\nIn October 2021, approximately 300 illegal miners, known as \u201czama zamas\u201d, attacked and shot at police and security officers when the officers tried to prevent them from delivering food parcels to underground miners. In June 2022, about 150 illegal miners stormed gold miner Sibanye-Stillwater\u2019s mothballed Cooke shaft near Randfontein in an attempt to gain control. And since last week, South Africans have been reeling at the horrific robbery and gang rape of a film crew at a mine dump close to West Village, a multi-racial suburb of Krugersdorp on the West Rand.\n\nWest Village community members have since spoken out about being \u201cprisoners in their own homes\u201d. They attribute rampant crime in the area over the last few years to the influx of illegal mining \u2013 a situation that law enforcement officials seem unable or unwilling to control.\n\nIn the wake of these incidents, the spotlight must turn to the systemic reasons artisanal gold mining has become such a threat to peace and security. These include the state\u2019s decades-long failure to nip an unregulated and illegal artisanal gold mining industry in the bud. These incidents are also the result of the failure to formalise artisanal mining as a livelihood strategy through appropriate policies and legislative provisions.\n\nFailed opportunities to formalise artisanal mining\nArtisanal mining is a labour-intensive form of mining that uses rudimentary tools and technologies. Other sub-Saharan African countries recognise artisanal mining as a formal mining category. These include Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia and Kenya.\n\nRead more: https:\/\/theconversation.com\/artisanal-gold-mining-in-south-africa-is-out-of-control-mistakes-that-got-it-here-188038","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165960275018154.png","Account Created Date":"2022-04-20 11:35:00","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-04-20","Interest":"the conversation","Sports Events":"Invictus Games, World Snooker Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"Pan African Film & Arts Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":30.76,"New COVID Cases":2380.0,"New Deaths":56.0,"New Vaccinations":744947.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Watch the uncensored moment Will Smith smacks Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, drops F-bomb","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Guardian News","YouTube Trending Video Category":"News & Politics","YouTube Trending Video Views":97122193.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1427129.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Illegal and unregulated artisanal gold mining on the Witwatersrand Basin located south of South Africa s Gauteng province is an increasing threat to community industrial and state security Reports on turf wars between rival gangs or shootouts between illegal miners and security officers are commonplace But recent incidents point to a spike in the scale of illegal activity conflict and criminality In October approximately illegal miners known as zama zamas attacked and shot at police and security officers when the officers tried to prevent them from delivering food parcels to underground miners In June about illegal miners stormed gold miner Sibanye Stillwater s mothballed Cooke shaft near Randfontein in an attempt to gain control And since last week South Africans have been reeling at the horrific robbery and gang rape of a film crew at a mine dump close to West Village a multi racial suburb of Krugersdorp on the West Rand West Village community members have since spoken out about being prisoners in their own homes They attribute rampant crime in the area over the last few years to the influx of illegal mining a situation that law enforcement officials seem unable or unwilling to control In the wake of these incidents the spotlight must turn to the systemic reasons artisanal gold mining has become such a threat to peace and security These include the state s decades long failure to nip an unregulated and illegal artisanal gold mining industry in the bud These incidents are also the result of the failure to formalise artisanal mining as a livelihood strategy through appropriate policies and legislative provisions Failed opportunities to formalise artisanal mining Artisanal mining is a labour intensive form of mining that uses rudimentary tools and technologies Other sub Saharan African countries recognise artisanal mining as a formal mining category These include Burkina Faso C te d Ivoire the Democratic Republic of Congo Ethiopia and Kenya Read more ","Translated Title":"Artisanal gold mining in South Africa is out of control.

Yuna Lee charged with murder","Narrative":"Murder charges were filed Monday against a homeless man accused of following a woman into her Chinatown building and stabbing her more than 40 times inside her apartment as she desperately screamed for help.\n\nVictim Christina Yuna Lee\u2019s cries were still ringing in the ears of a neighbor a day after he called 911 hoping against hope that police would arrive in time to save her from an intruder.\n\nThe arriving officers heard her screams, but she soon went silent \u2014 and her killer tried in vain to convince them to leave by mimicking a woman\u2019s voice and saying she didn\u2019t need police.\n\nBy the time cops got inside the apartment, Lee, her body naked from the waist up, was dead in a bathtub. Her bloodied suspected killer, Assamad Nash, was hiding under a bed, cops said.\n\n\u201cI heard her screaming for help,\u201d the 24-year-old neighbor said. \u201cI went out into the hallway when I heard the first commotion. I heard someone else inside her apartment. He was trying to make her quiet, not in an aggressive way. I heard something that made it seem like he possibly had a firearm; because of that I went back into my own apartment. I was scared for my own safety.

Private virtual currencies do not represent any person's debt or liabilities as there is no issuer.\n\nIndia's official digital currency is likely to debut by early 2023, which will mirror any of the currently available private company-operated electronic wallets. The CBDC will be a sovereign-backed digital currency.\n\nTouching upon the role of fintechs in the fast evolving digital payments space, the official said that the RBI has fostered innovation and it is keeping a close eye on the benefits and risks associated with innovative products and services offered by fintechs.\n\nAs fintech adoption picked up in the country, the Reserve Bank issued guidelines regulations for emerging areas such as payment banks in 2014, account aggregator in 2016, pre-paid instruments in 2017, peer-to-peer lending in 2017, invoice discounting 2018 to facilitate the industry in digital and for facilitating onboarding of consumers, individuals as well as KYC documentation, the official said.\n\nRead the full story here:- https:\/\/www.newsdrum.in\/business\/phased-implementation-of-digital-currency-for-wholesale-retail-segments-at-works-rbi-official-62454.html","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165831107256731.png","Account Created Date":"2022-03-09 17:45:49","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-03-09","Interest":"newsdrum","Sports Events":"Six Nations, Winter Paralympics, ODI World Cup for women","Associated Film Festivals":"Glasgow International Film Festival 2022, Santa Barbara International Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1062.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":332.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":33.68,"New COVID Cases":4184.0,"New Deaths":104.0,"New Vaccinations":1967095.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J.

The first leg of their Round of 16 contest ended 1-1 in Madrid, so this is the second leg.\n\nAfter a 3-2 win over Tottenham Hotspur at the weekend, Ralf Rangnick's side returned to winning ways in the Premier League. Against Spurs, Ronaldo scored his first hat-trick of the season, including a breathtaking long-range goal in the first half.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo has rediscovered his goal-scoring form just in time for Manchester United's match against Atletico Madrid. With a win over the La Liga champions, they will advance to the Champions League quarterfinals. Since the 2018-19 season, the Red Devils have not advanced to the tournament's quarterfinals.\n\nOn Tuesday at Old Trafford, Ronaldo is set to start up front for United. In attack, Jadon Sancho and Anthony Elanga might join the 37-year-old forward, with Bruno Fernandes playing as an attacking midfielder. In the front three, Ralf Rangnick will have to choose between Elanga and Marcus Rashford.\n\nFrom his time at Real Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo had a strong record versus Atletico Madrid. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner has faced Atletico 36 times, scoring 25 goals and assisting on nine occasio\nDiego Simeone's team enters the encounter at Old Trafford fresh off a 2-1 La Liga victory over Cadiz.\n\nManchester United's leading goal scorer this season has been Cristiano Ronaldo. The 37-year-old attacker is the Red Devils' top scorer at the moment. In 31 games for United this season, Ronaldo has scored 18 goals and contributed three assists.\n\nHowever, the situation for the Portuguese forward has not been ideal. Ronaldo had only scored once in his previous ten Manchester United matches in all competitions prior to his hat-trick against Tottenham.\n\nDespite a goalless start to the new year, the former Real Madrid and Juventus forward remains the club's top scorer this season","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-164736670646792.png","Account Created Date":"2022-03-01 16:06:48","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-03-01","Interest":"cristiano ronaldo, champions league, athletico madrid, ralf ragnick, football","Sports Events":"Six Nations","Associated Film Festivals":null,"Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1062.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":332.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":37.84,"New COVID Cases":7554.0,"New Deaths":223.0,"New Vaccinations":1495732.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J.

The Double Asteroid Redirection Test \u2013 or DART \u2013 is meant to test one potential approach that could prevent an asteroid from colliding with Earth. David Barnhart is a professor of astronautics at the University of Southern California and director of the Space Engineering Research Center there. He watched NASA\u2019s live stream of the successful mission and explains what is known so far.1. What do the images show?The first images, taken by a camera aboard DART, show the double asteroid system of Didymos \u2013 about 2,500 feet (780 meters) in diameter \u2013 being orbited by the smaller asteroid Dimorphos that is about 525 feet (160 meters) long.As the targeting algorithm on DART locked onto Dimorphos, the craft adjusted its flight and began heading towards the smaller of the two asteroids. The image taken at 11 seconds before impact and 42 miles (68 kilometers) from Dimorphos shows the asteroid centered in the camera\u2019s field of view. This meant that the targeting algorithm was fairly accurate and the craft would collide right at the center of Dimorphos.The second-to-last image, taken two seconds before impact shows the rocky surface of Dimorphos, including small shadows. These shadows are interesting because they suggest that the camera aboard the DART spacecraft was seeing Dimorphos directly on but the Sun was at an angle relative to the camera. They imply the DART spacecraft was centered on its trajectory to impact Dimorphos at the moment, but it\u2019s also possible the asteroid was slowly rotating relative to the camera.Read more: https:\/\/theconversation.com\/nasa-crashed-a-spacecraft-into-an-asteroid-photos-show-the-last-moments-of-the-successful-dart-mission-191402","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166434760154291.jpeg","Account Created Date":"2022-04-20 11:35:32","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-04-20","Interest":"Technology, History, Food, Entertainment, Sports, Environment, Science, Inequality, Education, Health, Politics, Economy, Climate change ","Sports Events":"Invictus Games, World Snooker Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"Pan African Film & Arts Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":30.76,"New COVID Cases":2380.0,"New Deaths":56.0,"New Vaccinations":744947.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Watch the uncensored moment Will Smith smacks Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, drops F-bomb","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Guardian News","YouTube Trending Video Category":"News & Politics","YouTube Trending Video Views":97122193.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1427129.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"In a world first NASA has crashed a spacecraft into an asteroid in an attempt to push the rocky traveler off its trajectory The Double Asteroid Redirection Test or DART is meant to test one potential approach that could prevent an asteroid from colliding with Earth David Barnhart is a professor of astronautics at the University of Southern California and director of the Space Engineering Research Center there He watched NASA s live stream of the successful mission and explains what is known so far What do the images show The first images taken by a camera aboard DART show the double asteroid system of Didymos about feet meters in diameter being orbited by the smaller asteroid Dimorphos that is about feet meters long As the targeting algorithm on DART locked onto Dimorphos the craft adjusted its flight and began heading towards the smaller of the two asteroids The image taken at seconds before impact and miles kilometers from Dimorphos shows the asteroid centered in the camera s field of view This meant that the targeting algorithm was fairly accurate and the craft would collide right at the center of Dimorphos The second to last image taken two seconds before impact shows the rocky surface of Dimorphos including small shadows These shadows are interesting because they suggest that the camera aboard the DART spacecraft was seeing Dimorphos directly on but the Sun was at an angle relative to the camera They imply the DART spacecraft was centered on its trajectory to impact Dimorphos at the moment but it s also possible the asteroid was slowly rotating relative to the camera Read more ","Translated Title":"NASA crashed a spacecraft into an asteroid \u2013 photos show the last moments of the successful DART","GeoTopic Name":null,"GeoTopic Latitude":null,"GeoTopic Longitude":null,"caption_generation":"a group of young men riding skateboards down a street .","object_recognition":"['torch', 'maypole']","toxicity":0.0003929978,"severe_toxicity":0.0000012738,"obscene":0.0000266435,"identity_attack":0.0000915985,"insult":0.0001202956,"threat":0.0000154414,"sexual_explicit":0.000016341},{"Dataset Index":85886,"Story Primary ID":136510,"Story ID":"STY1662210801","User Primary ID":85752,"User ID":"USR1662207506","Gender":null,"Age":19,"Title":"Ganpati bappa morya\u2764\ufe0f","Narrative":"Ganpati bappa morya\u2764\ufe0f","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166221070220709.png","Account Created Date":"2022-09-03 17:48:26","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-09-03","Interest":"Technology, History, Food, Entertainment, Sports, Environment, Science, Inequality, Education, Health, Politics, Economy, Climate change ","Sports Events":"World Volleyball Championships (men), US Open","Associated Film Festivals":"Venice International Film Festival 2022, Telluride Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_3","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1128.48,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":363.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":11.22,"New COVID Cases":6809.0,"New Deaths":26.0,"New Vaccinations":2540787.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"BLACKPINK -

Indian Divorce (Amendment) Act, 2001\nThis is a must-know for every woman who is married or planning to get married. According to this law, marital rape and communicable STD (for a period of two years or more before the marriage) are grounds for divorce.\n\n4. The Medical Termination Of Pregnancy Act, 1971\nIf having a child is affecting your physical or mental health adversely, then it is legal for you to get an abortion in the first trimester. Also, if certain circumstances do not favor motherhood, it is legitimate grounds for abortion.\n\n5. Right against domestic violence\nEvery woman is entitled to the right against Domestic Violence with her by virtue of the enactment of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act in 2005.

The judiciary system as well as the policymakers are still trying to understand and bring out a regulatory policy for the gaming industry.\n\nMehta said, \u201cIf you have to look from an anthropological perspective, new industries come up and then there is a fight for their licenses. A lot of time regulations will follow the industry. I don\u2019t think this is happening for the first time. For example Crypto, regulations are still being made, the taxation from the earnings is 30%, and policy will always follow the industry till things are syncing. We are very confident that we answer all the questions that the policymakers might try to ask and at some point in time the whole transparency and symmetrical information will be starting to flow on both sides. If you see any industry anthropologically, they all go through the same. Digital business is very new for policymakers and anything new takes time to settle down. The policies will help to get more foreign investments to flow in the country and startup founders can say the legal frame of the country is pro-business.\u201d\n\nRead the full story here:- https:\/\/bestmediainfo.com\/2022\/05\/india-will-soon-be-the-net-exporter-of-gaming-talent-technology-zupee-s-gaurav-mehta","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165250375195427.png","Account Created Date":"2021-02-15 16:20:15","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-02-15","Interest":"bestmediainfo","Sports Events":"Six Nations, Australian Open, World Alpine Ski Championships","Associated Film Festivals":null,"Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":770.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":280.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":61.970001,"New COVID Cases":20770.0,"New Deaths":171.0,"New Vaccinations":464317.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"India claim stunning series win, end Australia's Gabba streak | Vodafone Test Series 2020-21","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"cricket.com.au","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Sports","YouTube Trending Video Views":37261157.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":806151.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"By Tanzila Shaikh As the gaming industry continues to grow steadily India will soon take a global stage in terms of exporting both talent and technology to the world said Gaurav Mehta Chief Marketing Officer at Zupee a skill based gaming platform In the month of February BestMediaInfo reported that The High Court of Karnataka has struck down key amendments to the Karnataka Police Act which were brought in last year to ban all forms of gambling including online in the state to curb the menace of gaming through Internet and apps The judiciary system as well as the policymakers are still trying to understand and bring out a regulatory policy for the gaming industry Mehta said If you have to look from an anthropological perspective new industries come up and then there is a fight for their licenses A lot of time regulations will follow the industry I don t think this is happening for the first time For example Crypto regulations are still being made the taxation from the earnings is and policy will always follow the industry till things are syncing We are very confident that we answer all the questions that the policymakers might try to ask and at some point in time the whole transparency and symmetrical information will be starting to flow on both sides If you see any industry anthropologically they all go through the same Digital business is very new for policymakers and anything new takes time to settle down The policies will help to get more foreign investments to flow in the country and startup founders can say the legal frame of the country is pro business Read the full story here ","Translated Title":"India will soon be the net exporter of gaming talent & technology: Zupee\u2019s Gaurav Mehta","GeoTopic Name":"British Indian Ocean Territory","GeoTopic Latitude":-6.0,"GeoTopic Longitude":72.0,"caption_generation":"a boat floating on top of a body of water .","object_recognition":"['suit, suit of clothes', 'trench coat']","toxicity":0.0011968155,"severe_toxicity":0.0000111647,"obscene":0.0000950163,"identity_attack":0.0008043646,"insult":0.0003346239,"threat":0.0000533353,"sexual_explicit":0.0001774952},{"Dataset Index":61138,"Story Primary ID":117797,"Story ID":"STY1658394783","User Primary ID":38871,"User ID":"USR1653310453","Gender":null,"Age":20,"Title":"Places for street food in chandni chowk","Narrative":"Delhi has the best street food where people from all over the world come to eat and experience.

He portrays himself as a traditional professional who can tackle any topic and personalize it with his own style and hobbies. Soderbergh is the most physical of all current Hollywood filmmakers, the one who comes closest to the painterly ideal of feeling the image. It's in his latest film, \"Kimi,\" which will premiere on HBO Max on Thursday. This is a delightful surprise, because the film's substance isn't visible in the foreground\u2014constructed it's as a standard genre piece.\n\nWith agoraphobic protagonist Angela Childs (Zoe  Kravitz) working tech support from home, this technological device is essentially a stand-in for Alexa or Google devices (not used name because crimes are heard and recorded on their behalf, while the company itself is involved in highly shady practices). Her job include debugging stream data communication issues between the user and the device\nAngela's agoraphobia is less compelling, which contributes to broad stereotypes and a disconcerting sense of dishonesty in the writing. Even Zoe Kravitz, who is fantastic in the role otherwise, is limited to exaggerating tics that overshadow the remainder of an unusually difficult performance.\n\nAll of the elements come across as parts of a character that never come together to form something meaningful; Kimi, at its core, is a story about shoving someone through a different kind of traumatic experience in order to reawaken their life. Hearing something along the lines of rape and murder on one of those tech-support audio recordings. As a result of the insidious erosion of the illusion of privacy brought on by such devices, and Angela's decision to take matters into her own hands,\nThe suspense element is well-crafted (there's an attempted kidnapping in broad daylight that is intensely framed and shot), and the chimes provide an odd dreamlike soundscape that matches Angela's persona when she eventually ventures out into Seattle to administer justice.Kimi is engaging enough that you won't want to turn the movie off with your own voice, but there's plenty of unfulfilled opportunity along the way.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-164597865732953.png","Account Created Date":"2022-01-31 14:45:53","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-01-31","Interest":"amazon prime, kimi, zoe kravitz, the batman, sci fi, review","Sports Events":"Africa Cup of Nations","Associated Film Festivals":"International Film Festival Rotterdam 2022, Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1062.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":332.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":32.540001,"New COVID Cases":167059.0,"New Deaths":1192.0,"New Vaccinations":7423888.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Help\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb#shorts","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"JANNA_Sega","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Gaming","YouTube Trending Video Views":39973005.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":2448039.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"sq","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"sq","Translated Narrative":"Steven Soderbergh is a director of contradictions who has grown incredibly prolific in the age of streaming He portrays himself as a traditional professional who can tackle any topic and personalize it with his own style and hobbies Soderbergh is the most physical of all current Hollywood filmmakers the one who comes closest to the painterly ideal of feeling the image It s in his latest film Kimi which will premiere on HBO Max on Thursday This is a delightful surprise because the film s substance isn t visible in the foreground constructed it s as a standard genre piece With agoraphobic protagonist Angela Childs Zoe Kravitz working tech support from home this technological device is essentially a stand in for Alexa or Google devices not used name because crimes are heard and recorded on their behalf while the company itself is involved in highly shady practices Her job include debugging stream data communication issues between the user and the device Angela s agoraphobia is less compelling which contributes to broad stereotypes and a disconcerting sense of dishonesty in the writing Even Zoe Kravitz who is fantastic in the role otherwise is limited to exaggerating tics that overshadow the remainder of an unusually difficult performance All of the elements come across as parts of a character that never come together to form something meaningful Kimi at its core is a story about shoving someone through a different kind of traumatic experience in order to reawaken their life Hearing something along the lines of rape and murder on one of those tech support audio recordings As a result of the insidious erosion of the illusion of privacy brought on by such devices and Angela s decision to take matters into her own hands The suspense element is well crafted there s an attempted kidnapping in broad daylight that is intensely framed and shot and the chimes provide an odd dreamlike soundscape that matches Angela s persona when she eventually ventures out into Seattle to administer justice Kimi is engaging enough that you won t want to turn the movie off with your own voice but there s plenty of unfulfilled opportunity along the way ","Translated Title":"Amazon Prime's Kimi","GeoTopic Name":"Seattle","GeoTopic Latitude":47.60621,"GeoTopic Longitude":-122.33207,"caption_generation":"a bowl of cereal and a banana on a table .","object_recognition":"['fur coat']","toxicity":0.0005702684,"severe_toxicity":0.0000018543,"obscene":0.0000548639,"identity_attack":0.0000762854,"insult":0.0001630798,"threat":0.0000178993,"sexual_explicit":0.0000198696},{"Dataset Index":2814,"Story Primary ID":88958,"Story ID":"STY1647958516","User Primary ID":472,"User ID":"USR1612356664","Gender":"male","Age":22,"Title":"Is a Nuremberg-style trial of Putin feasible?","Narrative":"Many believe Putin is more sinned against then sinning. Other world leaders, however, accuse him of grave crimes in his invasion of Ukraine. President Biden has called him a war criminal. Meanwhile, two former British prime ministers \u2013 Gordon Brown and Sir John Major \u2013 have demanded a special international tribunal to investigate Putin\u2019s actions in Ukraine.\n\nThe International Criminal Court has been probing Putin\u2019s \u201cwar crimes\u201d, but its powers are limited. The ICC works through the UN Security Council where Russia could use its veto: https:\/\/theconversation.com\/is-international-law-powerless-against-russian-aggression-in-ukraine-no-but-its-complicated-177905\n\nSo, a petition has been prepared, calling for a more powerful tribunal set up for the Ukraine war \u2013 like the one (the comparison is loaded) that held trials of Nazi war criminals after World War II in Nuremberg. Brown and Major have signed that petition. \n\n>>Petition:\nhttps:\/\/secure.avaaz.org\/campaign\/en\/prosecute_putin_loc_rb\/?cxNbweb\n\nBrown accuses Putin of replacing the democratic values by \u201cthe use of force\u201d: https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-60803155 He says Putin has indulged in indiscriminate bombing of civilians, which is against international law and breached humanitarian ceasefires. \n\n>>Brown writes why a \u2018Nuremberg-style trial\u2019 is needed for Putin:\nhttps:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-10629047\/For-Putin-pariah-justice-come.html\n\nWhether one agrees with the suggestion or not, it is not as easy as signing a petition. Firstly, setting up a tribunal like that is complicated. If it can be done, then evidence will have to be gathered for it. A children\u2019s hospital was bombed in Ukraine, and that\u2019s a war crime \u2013 even if Russia would like us to believe that the bombing was carried out by Ukrainian neo-Nazis.

Even after putting together a workable legal case, how do you bring the \u201cperpetrator\u201d to justice \u2013 as long as Putin remain in power in Russia?

Simmons has not yet played for the Nets, and somehow we are left wondering if the Sixers would take a mulligan on the trade.\n\nHarden is not the same top-three MVP candidate he was for four straight seasons from 2016-20, when his general manager informed us, \"It's just factual that James Harden is a better scorer than Michael Jordan.\"\n\nThat same executive, Daryl Morey, left Houston for Philadelphia in 2020, spent his first two seasons with the 76ers trying to reunite with Harden and succeeded at this year's trade deadline. Morey either ignored Harden's production in the meantime or felt confident the 10-time All-Star was sandbagging the rest of us.\n\nFrom 2016-20, 28.4 of Harden's league-leading 32.4 points per game (55.4 effective field-goal percentage) came inside of 8 feet, on pull-up 3-pointers or at the free-throw line. He was a one-man offense, spending possessions breaking down his defender off the dribble, looking for a step into a layup or out to a jumper.\n\nLosing a step is a bigger deal when one in either direction was your signature.\n\nHarden's points from inside of 8 feet, pull-up 3s and free throws are down to 19.5 per game (49.6 eFG%) this season. Of the 294 players who have attempted at least 200 shots inside of 8 feet, Harden's 48.8% success rate ranks 273rd, right between Devonte' Graham and Dennis Smith Jr. Among the 72 players who have attempted at least 100 pull-up 3s, Harden's 33.7% shooting ranks 39th. His free throws, which had risen to 11.8 per game in 2019-20 \u2014 the most by a guard since Jordan's 11.9 in 1986-87, are down to 8.3.\n\nWhere once Harden was a historic foul-drawing machine and an exceptional scoring guard at high volume from both beyond the arc and at the rim, he is now a mere mortal at getting to the free-throw line, a below-average shooter from distance and a poor finisher around the basket. That combination is a slippery slope.\n\nRead more\nhttps:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/nba-fact-or-fiction-the-james-harden-conundrum-202334825.html","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-164945969912767.png","Account Created Date":"2021-07-26 18:07:22","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-07-26","Interest":"Sports, basketball, nba, james harden","Sports Events":"Summer Olympics","Associated Film Festivals":"Transilvania International Film Festival","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_3","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1067.47,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":306.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":76.32,"New COVID Cases":29689.0,"New Deaths":415.0,"New Vaccinations":6716394.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Turn into orbeez - Tutorial #Shorts","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"FFUNTV","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Views":192368345.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":6390310.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"We are approaching the two month mark since the Philadelphia ers traded Ben Simmons Seth Curry Andre Drummond and two first round picks to the Brooklyn Nets for James Harden Simmons has not yet played for the Nets and somehow we are left wondering if the Sixers would take a mulligan on the trade Harden is not the same top three MVP candidate he was for four straight seasons from when his general manager informed us It s just factual that James Harden is a better scorer than Michael Jordan That same executive Daryl Morey left Houston for Philadelphia in spent his first two seasons with the ers trying to reunite with Harden and succeeded at this year s trade deadline Morey either ignored Harden s production in the meantime or felt confident the time All Star was sandbagging the rest of us From of Harden s league leading points per game effective field goal percentage came inside of feet on pull up pointers or at the free throw line He was a one man offense spending possessions breaking down his defender off the dribble looking for a step into a layup or out to a jumper Losing a step is a bigger deal when one in either direction was your signature Harden s points from inside of feet pull up s and free throws are down to per game eFG this season Of the players who have attempted at least shots inside of feet Harden s success rate ranks rd right between Devonte Graham and Dennis Smith Jr Among the players who have attempted at least pull up s Harden s shooting ranks th His free throws which had risen to per game in the most by a guard since Jordan s in are down to Where once Harden was a historic foul drawing machine and an exceptional scoring guard at high volume from both beyond the arc and at the rim he is now a mere mortal at getting to the free throw line a below average shooter from distance and a poor finisher around the basket That combination is a slippery slope Read more ","Translated Title":"NBA Fact or Fiction: The James Harden conundrum","GeoTopic Name":"Philadelphia County","GeoTopic Latitude":40.00764,"GeoTopic Longitude":-75.13396,"caption_generation":"a couple of remote controls sitting next to each other .","object_recognition":"['stage', 'king penguin, Aptenodytes patagonica']","toxicity":0.0018534501,"severe_toxicity":0.0000019356,"obscene":0.000088121,"identity_attack":0.0001667435,"insult":0.0005384715,"threat":0.0000313743,"sexual_explicit":0.0000204461},{"Dataset Index":25571,"Story Primary ID":122617,"Story ID":"STY1659803487","User Primary ID":40936,"User ID":"USR1654102043","Gender":"female","Age":19,"Title":"All Hail the Queens","Narrative":"Queen Bey enlisted the Queen of Pop for the new edition of \u201cBreak My Soul\u201d after she recently dropped four remixes of the Billboard Hot 100 top 10 smash by will.i.am, Terry Hunter, Honey Dijon and Nita Aviance.

Silent Pages of Rajagriha : The first Budhhist Council","Narrative":"However, Cunningham again visited Rajagriha in 1872 and this time identified the Son Bhandar cave as the Sattapanni Cave, where the first Buddhist Council was held after Buddha\u2019s death. This however, was later refuted by others, when\u00a0another cave on another face of the Vaibhargiri\u00a0was identified as the Saptaparni or Sattapanni by\u00a0Beglar. Cunningham mentioned that\u00a0Mr. Beal\u00a0had opposed the identification of the Son Bhandar with the Sattapani, since Fa-Hian had described the cave as being on the northern shade of the mountain, whereas Son Bhandar was on the southern face. Cunningham in support of his arguments mentioned that the Baibhar mountain did not lie east and west like Mount Vipula, but as nearly as possible north-east and south-west in orientation; and thus the north-east half of it could be called either the \u201cnorth end\u201d or the \u201ceast end\u201d. Cunningham argued that in his survey, the Son Bhandar cave was actually situated in the northern half, or end, of the mountain, and therefore it truly described the position given by the Chinese pilgrims. But to make this identification certain, he made efforts to trace the second cave or \u201cPippala Cave\u201d, as mentioned in the accounts of Fa-Hian and Hieun Thsang.\nThe account of Fa-Hian as at No. 3 above has been important for the identification of theb caves.\u00a0Hwen Thsang\u2019s account agrees substantially with the description of Fa-Hian, but he adds some particulars which give most valuable assistance in identifying the first cave. His words are \u201cTo the west of the hot springs stands the stone house of\u00a0Pi-po-lo, in which Buddha formerly lived. The deep cave which opens behind its wall was the\u00a0palace of the Asuras.

You might be preparing for a big job interview or you might just wake up in the morning and, without warning, the dread hits.\n\nAnxiety is the most common mental health condition, affecting roughly one in four Australians in their lifetime. Young people described their experiences of anxiety for an\u00a0episode of\u00a0Enough,\u00a0The Age\u00a0and\u00a0The Sydney Morning Herald\u2019s youth mental health podcast.\n\nThere is a big difference between the disorder \u2013 which is a serious mental illness characterised by an excessive sense of worry or fear \u2013 and simply feeling stressed or worried, however everyone can feel anxious from time to time.\n\n1. List out your anxiety as specifically as possible. For example: I\u2019m anxious about posting my art online.\n\n2. Then, list a simple strategy (or two) to get around some of the potentially negative consequences of this anxiety. For example, when I\u2019m over-committed I find getting organised with calendars and to-do-lists enough to provide mild relief.\n\n3. From here, you write out the likely outcome of your situation. If you\u2019re anxious that you\u2019ll die in a plane crash, the likely outcome is that you won\u2019t. While we rationally know this, it\u2019s sometimes nice just to spell it out.\n\n4. Next, you ask: what anxiety does this anxiety replace? It\u2019s good to recognise that your current worries might be better than the alternatives their presence rules out. If you\u2019re worried about whether or not your kids will grow up in a house you own, one anxiety this displaces is the anxiety that you might never have children at all.\n\n5. Finally, ask: how is this anxiety trying to protect you? If you\u2019re anxious about losing your job, the anxiety might be trying to protect you from the looming (very real) problems that come with a lack of cash. If you\u2019re anxious about having too much work, the anxiety might be trying to protect you from stress. The purpose of this is that it frames anxiety as a protective coping mechanism. Whether this is true or not, it can provide a bit of relief.\n\nRead the entire article here \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffbhttps:\/\/www.smh.com.au\/lifestyle\/health-and-wellness\/breathe-talk-run-five-people-s-tips-for-managing-your-anxiety-20220413-p5adco.html","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165006541422960.png","Account Created Date":"2022-04-06 06:44:06","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-04-06","Interest":"mental health, australia, lifestyle","Sports Events":null,"Associated Film Festivals":"Hong Kong International Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":36.470001,"New COVID Cases":1033.0,"New Deaths":43.0,"New Vaccinations":2196053.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Harry Styles - As It Was (Official Video)","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"HarryStylesVEVO","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Music","YouTube Trending Video Views":40089505.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":2294419.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Anxiety can come on suddenly and unpredictably You might be preparing for a big job interview or you might just wake up in the morning and without warning the dread hits Anxiety is the most common mental health condition affecting roughly one in four Australians in their lifetime Young people described their experiences of anxiety for an episode of Enough The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald s youth mental health podcast There is a big difference between the disorder which is a serious mental illness characterised by an excessive sense of worry or fear and simply feeling stressed or worried however everyone can feel anxious from time to time List out your anxiety as specifically as possible For example I m anxious about posting my art online Then list a simple strategy or two to get around some of the potentially negative consequences of this anxiety For example when I m over committed I find getting organised with calendars and to do lists enough to provide mild relief From here you write out the likely outcome of your situation If you re anxious that you ll die in a plane crash the likely outcome is that you won t While we rationally know this it s sometimes nice just to spell it out Next you ask what anxiety does this anxiety replace It s good to recognise that your current worries might be better than the alternatives their presence rules out If you re worried about whether or not your kids will grow up in a house you own one anxiety this displaces is the anxiety that you might never have children at all Finally ask how is this anxiety trying to protect you If you re anxious about losing your job the anxiety might be trying to protect you from the looming very real problems that come with a lack of cash If you re anxious about having too much work the anxiety might be trying to protect you from stress The purpose of this is that it frames anxiety as a protective coping mechanism Whether this is true or not it can provide a bit of relief Read the entire article here ","Translated Title":"Breathe, talk, run: tips for managing your anxiety","GeoTopic Name":"Anxiety Aerodrome","GeoTopic Latitude":32.03765,"GeoTopic Longitude":-96.53165,"caption_generation":"a man is holding a cell phone to his ear .","object_recognition":"['reel']","toxicity":0.39092493,"severe_toxicity":0.0003578393,"obscene":0.029290179,"identity_attack":0.004469082,"insult":0.01556415,"threat":0.0003686919,"sexual_explicit":0.403502},{"Dataset Index":57172,"Story Primary ID":115043,"Story ID":"STY1657484136","User Primary ID":33782,"User ID":"USR1650904743","Gender":"male","Age":26,"Title":"Memories and Cinema","Narrative":"Through movies, memories are never lost.\nCinema knows how to capture and keep the most important chapters of life.\nIt ensures us that memories never wane; they can be remembered and revisited from time to time.\n\nThe idea of calling memories a \"timeless entity\" makes cinema more phenomenal; the fetters of past or present do not confine it because it knows at the end what matters are the faces that sparkle up and the eyes brimming up with tears while visiting or remembering the moments that cinema has preserved for them.\n\nMemories within memories show the characters visiting flashbacks and moments of the past; this way, it adheres to the process of memory-making and portrays cinema in its most beautiful ways.\n\nWhat would it be to live without memories and reminiscence?

Be it behind the scenes, off the field or on it.\nAnother change of figure at the manager's chair has come to the supporters as a sign of positivity around a dire situation and miserable end to the season. Erik ten Hag from Netherlands, the ex Ajax boss has taken over the coaching duties for the Mancunian club.\nHis arrival means a lot of targets from the Dutch league or his former players will be targetted by the club especially in the midfield area, then an attacker and then the defensive side including the fullback position.\nFrenkie de Jong of Barcelona, a very highly rated midfielder who is young is likely to be the first incoming to mark open the Ten Hag era. As we spoke, it is a deal happening due to the financial situation at the Catalonia club and then how much Erik admires him, so good that he defines de Jong's role to be the centre of his project. Alternative to Frenkie or maybe a midfield duo with Wolves' Ruben Neves can be seen happening. Ibrahim Sangar\u00e9 of PSV Eindhoven & N'golo Kante of Chelsea are also likely, players with the profile that is much needed and a role that seems to be forgotten about by the club all in all since a long time now.\nAnother Dutchman in Jurrien Timber, the Ajax centre half is looked after to resolve the defensive situation at Manchester United. A young, versatile player with certainly definite defensive traits could be a solid addition to Ten Hag's new project. One of Pau Torres, Sven Botman and Alessandro Bastoni are options in the defense department who might be seen coming through the door at Old Trafford.\nForwards being sorted out included Darwin Nunez of Benfica who is all set to join arch rivals Liverpool in a record breaking deal for the Anfield club. Gianluca Scamacca of Sassuolo, Martin Terrier of Rennes, Antony another of the manager's former players and Sasa Kalajdzic of VFB Stuttgart are followed closely to fulfill the role of a goalscorer.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165496298795819.png","Account Created Date":"2021-11-30 17:06:41","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-11-30","Interest":"Sports, football","Sports Events":null,"Associated Film Festivals":"French Film Festival, Made In Prague Festival, Ventana Sur","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_4","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1297.89,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":319.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":47.610001,"New COVID Cases":8954.0,"New Deaths":267.0,"New Vaccinations":8563136.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"$456,000 Squid Game In Real Life!","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"MrBeast","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Views":122021654.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":10273561.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Manchester United Football Club over the last decade has seen a lot of changes happening Be it behind the scenes off the field or on it Another change of figure at the manager s chair has come to the supporters as a sign of positivity around a dire situation and miserable end to the season Erik ten Hag from Netherlands the ex Ajax boss has taken over the coaching duties for the Mancunian club His arrival means a lot of targets from the Dutch league or his former players will be targetted by the club especially in the midfield area then an attacker and then the defensive side including the fullback position Frenkie de Jong of Barcelona a very highly rated midfielder who is young is likely to be the first incoming to mark open the Ten Hag era As we spoke it is a deal happening due to the financial situation at the Catalonia club and then how much Erik admires him so good that he defines de Jong s role to be the centre of his project Alternative to Frenkie or maybe a midfield duo with Wolves Ruben Neves can be seen happening Ibrahim Sangar of PSV Eindhoven N golo Kante of Chelsea are also likely players with the profile that is much needed and a role that seems to be forgotten about by the club all in all since a long time now Another Dutchman in Jurrien Timber the Ajax centre half is looked after to resolve the defensive situation at Manchester United A young versatile player with certainly definite defensive traits could be a solid addition to Ten Hag s new project One of Pau Torres Sven Botman and Alessandro Bastoni are options in the defense department who might be seen coming through the door at Old Trafford Forwards being sorted out included Darwin Nunez of Benfica who is all set to join arch rivals Liverpool in a record breaking deal for the Anfield club Gianluca Scamacca of Sassuolo Martin Terrier of Rennes Antony another of the manager s former players and Sasa Kalajdzic of VFB Stuttgart are followed closely to fulfill the role of a goalscorer ","Translated Title":"MUFC: The Incomings","GeoTopic Name":"Manchester","GeoTopic Latitude":53.41667,"GeoTopic Longitude":-2.25,"caption_generation":"a sign on the side of a building .","object_recognition":"['packet', 'paper towel']","toxicity":0.0004019986,"severe_toxicity":0.0000011907,"obscene":0.0000295431,"identity_attack":0.0000685377,"insult":0.0001204433,"threat":0.0000142397,"sexual_explicit":0.0000112682},{"Dataset Index":34648,"Story Primary ID":80707,"Story ID":"STY1644593730","User Primary ID":23728,"User ID":"USR1642615528","Gender":null,"Age":63,"Title":"Basket, Varese: ingaggiato Tomas Woldetensae","Narrative":"La Pallacanestro Openjobmetis Varese ha ufficializzato l'ingaggio di Tomas Woldetensae, guardia-ala di 24 anni rientrato in Italia la scorsa estate dopo un'esperienza di sei anni negli Stati Uniti. \n\nWoldetensae, bolognese di nascita, da qualche mese si era accasato in serie A2 al Chieti.

But the recent drone strike couldn't be hidden.\n\nLater the UAE claimed that it had intercepted missiles fired by Houthis. On Wednesday, what came as a surprise was attack by drones by a little known group in Iraq. But what was clear for the region's defence analysts is that this was an Iran-backed group. (https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2022\/1\/31\/uae-intercepts-houthi-missile-as-israeli-president-visits)\n\nSeeing the rising threat the U.S. State Department has approved potential sales of fighter jets and air defense systems to the UAE, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. The sales could include fighter jets, air defence system upgrades and munitions. The U.S. has said that it has done so to \"stabilise\" the region.\n\nTehran has released a statement about a phone conversation between its Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and his UAE counterpart, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed. And it is very clear that Iran is miffed. According to the Iranian state news agency IRNA Amirabdollahian told his counterpart that \"the Zionist regime's presence is a threat to the regional security.\" \n\nThe attack from the Iraqi group Alwiyat al-Waad al-Haq (True Promise Brigades), could be a message from Iran that it is not happy with UAE growing closer to Israel.

China has also said that there should be no movement of foreign ships and aircraft in this area till Sunday. In fact, when Russia attacked Ukraine earlier this year, it became clear that this would encourage countries like China to show aggression. It is not accidental that Russia has backed China on this, which was furious over Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\nThe aggression of Chinese President Xi Jinping, though, is understandable. He is about to start a record third term as president a few months from now and in such a situation wants to record his name in history by embodying the plan to include Taiwan in China. But the major problem here for China is that the world's view of Wsthe 'One China Policy' that it is repeatedly reminding about to maintain its supremacy over Taiwan, Hong Kong and Tibet has started changing rapidly. That being said, China, showing its expansionist attitude around the world, cannot justify its dominance in Taiwan or Hong Kong in the name of the 'One China Policy.\nThere also exists an undeniable reality that Taiwan, an independent island that China claims as its own, chooses its government, has its army, generates its revenue and has its passport. \nNancy Pelosi was given a warm welcome in Taiwan and was bestowed with Taiwan's highest civilian honour and President Tsai tweeted that \"Democratic countries stand together in times of shared challenges\". Taiwan, although is not intimidated by threats from China, but condemning the Chinese aggression is not enough.\u00a0 Democratic powers around the world, including the US, will also have to do everything possible to ensure that Taiwan does not become another Ukraine.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165970858467845.png","Account Created Date":"2021-07-27 13:03:33","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-07-27","Interest":"geopolitics, international relations, china-taiwan, usa, trending story","Sports Events":"Summer Olympics","Associated Film Festivals":"Transilvania International Film Festival","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_3","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1067.47,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":306.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":73.970001,"New COVID Cases":43654.0,"New Deaths":640.0,"New Vaccinations":4244264.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Turn into orbeez - Tutorial #Shorts","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"FFUNTV","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Views":193336322.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":6417890.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Enraged by the visit of Nancy Pelosi Speaker of the US Congress and one of the most powerful leaders there China s threat of targeted missile strikes on Taiwan s air and sea borders till Sunday is extremely worrying and after the Ukraine crisis is another great threat to world peace It wouldn t be a surprise if this Chinese aggression turns into a major global crisis because Beijing s move is more about stopping the movement of ports in addition to stopping supplies in Taiwan China has also said that there should be no movement of foreign ships and aircraft in this area till Sunday In fact when Russia attacked Ukraine earlier this year it became clear that this would encourage countries like China to show aggression It is not accidental that Russia has backed China on this which was furious over Nancy Pelosi s visit to Taiwan The aggression of Chinese President Xi Jinping though is understandable He is about to start a record third term as president a few months from now and in such a situation wants to record his name in history by embodying the plan to include Taiwan in China But the major problem here for China is that the world s view of Wsthe One China Policy that it is repeatedly reminding about to maintain its supremacy over Taiwan Hong Kong and Tibet has started changing rapidly That being said China showing its expansionist attitude around the world cannot justify its dominance in Taiwan or Hong Kong in the name of the One China Policy There also exists an undeniable reality that Taiwan an independent island that China claims as its own chooses its government has its army generates its revenue and has its passport Nancy Pelosi was given a warm welcome in Taiwan and was bestowed with Taiwan s highest civilian honour and President Tsai tweeted that Democratic countries stand together in times of shared challenges Taiwan although is not intimidated by threats from China but condemning the Chinese aggression is not enough Democratic powers around the world including the US will also have to do everything possible to ensure that Taiwan does not become another Ukraine ","Translated Title":"Comment | Is it Taiwan's turn next?","GeoTopic Name":"People\u2019s Republic of China","GeoTopic Latitude":35.0,"GeoTopic Longitude":105.0,"caption_generation":"a group of people standing around a fire hydrant .","object_recognition":"[\"academic gown, academic robe, judge's robe\", 'military uniform']","toxicity":0.000482275,"severe_toxicity":0.0000015371,"obscene":0.0000327505,"identity_attack":0.0000832701,"insult":0.0001055797,"threat":0.0000238782,"sexual_explicit":0.0000178311},{"Dataset Index":42901,"Story Primary ID":83146,"Story ID":"STY1645531745","User Primary ID":28177,"User ID":"USR1645531707","Gender":null,"Age":21,"Title":"Black panther new movie","Narrative":"Marvel Studios\u2019 Black Panther: Wakanda Forever will resume production from next week.\nWakanda Forever is the sequel to the 2018 global hit Black Panther, headlined by Hollywood star Chadwick Boseman who passed away on August 28, 2020 following a private, four year-long battle with colon cancer.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-16455317236412.jpeg","Account Created Date":"2022-02-22 17:38:27","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-02-22","Interest":"srcc, entertainment","Sports Events":"Six Nations","Associated Film Festivals":null,"Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1062.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":332.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":36.869999,"New COVID Cases":15102.0,"New Deaths":278.0,"New Vaccinations":3732039.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J.

Many managers preferred him as a defender who worked well with any center-back. Luiz was a great passer of the ball with leadership qualities that many people have forgotten.\nHe made 143 appearances for the club and was instrumental in their Champions League victory over Bayern Munich.\n4 Ricardo Carvalho\nWhen Mourinho took over as manager of Chelsea, he decided to bring in his Porto guardian Ricardo Carvalho and the price was worth it because he was a quiet player who was hot-headed and was not an English outspoken player in the club. On the field, he evidenced his qualities through his intelligence and understanding of the game.\nCarvalho formed an excellent defensive partnership with John Terry, assisting the club to its first league title in 50 years. On their way to the title, the club only allowed 15 goals. He was an excellent defender who helped his team win three league titles.\n3 Ashley Cole\nCole's arrival at Chelsea was marred by controversy, as he was signed from Arsenal, causing uproar within the club. When it came to light that he wanted to sign for Chelsea and met Jose Mourinho on Arsenal's back, both player and manager were fined by the court. Aside from that, he was established as one of Chelsea's best left-backs.\nHe was quick, intelligent, and effective in both offense and defense. Cole won the champions League and the Premier League during his eight years at the club.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166367780884109.png","Account Created Date":"2022-09-05 15:01:39","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-09-05","Interest":"chelsea, defenders, davidluiz, ricardocarvalho, ashleycole","Sports Events":"World Volleyball Championships (men), US Open","Associated Film Festivals":"Venice International Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_3","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1128.48,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":363.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":11.22,"New COVID Cases":4417.0,"New Deaths":23.0,"New Vaccinations":2925199.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"BLACKPINK -

Yet, the realities of sexuality and intimacy in space are mostly omitted.How will people be able to live for prolonged periods of time in the isolated, confined and extreme conditions of spacecrafts and other planets? How will people navigate falling in love, having sex and beginning and ending relationships under such conditions? How will people deal with the stress, limited choice of intimate partners and issues related to consent? And how will sexual harassment or assault be prevented or addressed?On Oct. 15, 2017, #MeToo ushered in a global movement against sexual harassment and assault.

they're meant to be","Narrative":"Rekindled love stories abound in films, and the majority of them end happily. According to a survey, 102 out of 120 films about rekindled love ended happily, which is an overwhelming majority. Is this, however, also true in real life?\n\nSurprisingly, this is the case. Second chance at love with the same person can be much more than a reigniting of passion and nostalgia. Given the history and intricacy of these relationships, the intensity and emotion felt while reconciling with an old love may seem unfathomable. These rekindled romances appeared to be even more passionate than romantic movies would suggest: 71 percent of those in the study said that their reunion was the most intense romance they\u2019d ever had. This was proven in their 78 percent success rate in staying together.\n\nAnd like they say, sometimes two people have to fall apart to realize just how badly they need to fall back together. People can change and evolve through going through dark moments of loss and heartbreak. \n\nPeople who have worked through severe relationship sorrow understand that going to a deeper, better place takes a lot of self-reflection, professional counselling, and meditation or prayer. However, if a relationship is designed to be repaired after a breakup, it can only be done if both partners are prepared to undergo the work of introspection. And that's a lesson that every lover can learn from, regardless of their individual circumstances or whether they've formally ended a relationship.\n\nIt's sometimes because you realise after a while that the person you've broken up with is YOUR person. It's sometimes because their love for one another was greater and more vital than everything else. Sometimes it's just because you've grown accustomed to having that person around you and in your life, and you think it'd be a good idea to start again.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-164962367513395.png","Account Created Date":"2022-03-14 22:18:23","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-03-14","Interest":"jennifer lopez, ben affleck, romance, love stories","Sports Events":"Six Nations, ODI World Cup for women","Associated Film Festivals":"SXSW 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1062.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":332.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":28.0,"New COVID Cases":2568.0,"New Deaths":97.0,"New Vaccinations":1795410.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J.

Another source claimed that verification was done to guarantee compliance, including aerial monitoring.\nThe disengagement's specifics and procedures, however, were not made public. Previously, buffer zones were established at the points of friction in accordance with the understanding at the Corps Commander level. Until overall disengagement and de-escalation was achieved, neither side was to conduct any patrolling; instead, new patrolling guidelines were to be developed by the two sides.\nAs was previously reported, since the start of the standoff, Chinese forces have been heavily present in the Depsang plains, particularly in a key region known as the Bulge. In addition, PLA soldiers have been preventing Indian Army patrols from reaching the PPs 10, 11, 11A, 12, and 13, which are situated on the Limit of Patrolling, which is located much before the LAC. Senior officials told The Hindu that the Indian Army last accessed the PPs in Depsang in January or February 2020.\nChinese troops are getting closer to the vital 255 km Darbuk-Skyok-DBO road, which is a threat to Indian positions at Burtse and Raki Nala, which are both inside Indian territory, as well as Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO). Depsang is very near to the Karakoram pass and has a crucial view of the Siachen glacier and Saltoro ridge.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166309233655909.png","Account Created Date":"2022-05-17 19:01:50","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-05-17","Interest":"Technology, History, Food, Entertainment, Sports, Environment, Science, Inequality, Education, Health, Politics, Economy, Climate change , #ladakh","Sports Events":"South-East Asian Games, World Masters Games (Summer), IIHF World Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"Cannes Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":24.540001,"New COVID Cases":1829.0,"New Deaths":33.0,"New Vaccinations":1297045.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"The Witch TERRIFIES Simon Cowell to the CORE! | Auditions | BGT 2022","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Britain's Got Talent","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Views":16609383.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":198076.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"The pullout from Patrolling Point PP in the Gogra Hot Springs region of Eastern Ladakh was officially completed on Tuesday according to reports after verification by India and China The troops on both sides have returned to their respective areas after a staged coordinated and verified pullout at PP according to a defence source Another source claimed that verification was done to guarantee compliance including aerial monitoring The disengagement s specifics and procedures however were not made public Previously buffer zones were established at the points of friction in accordance with the understanding at the Corps Commander level Until overall disengagement and de escalation was achieved neither side was to conduct any patrolling instead new patrolling guidelines were to be developed by the two sides As was previously reported since the start of the standoff Chinese forces have been heavily present in the Depsang plains particularly in a key region known as the Bulge In addition PLA soldiers have been preventing Indian Army patrols from reaching the PPs A and which are situated on the Limit of Patrolling which is located much before the LAC Senior officials told The Hindu that the Indian Army last accessed the PPs in Depsang in January or February Chinese troops are getting closer to the vital km Darbuk Skyok DBO road which is a threat to Indian positions at Burtse and Raki Nala which are both inside Indian territory as well as Daulat Beg Oldie DBO Depsang is very near to the Karakoram pass and has a crucial view of the Siachen glacier and Saltoro ridge ","Translated Title":"Withdrawal confirm of troops between  India and China  from PP15 in Ladakh.","GeoTopic Name":"British Indian Ocean Territory","GeoTopic Latitude":-6.0,"GeoTopic Longitude":72.0,"caption_generation":"a couple of women standing next to each other .","object_recognition":"['comic book']","toxicity":0.00042159,"severe_toxicity":0.0000012954,"obscene":0.0000338874,"identity_attack":0.0000648798,"insult":0.0001181392,"threat":0.000016202,"sexual_explicit":0.0000126004},{"Dataset Index":79107,"Story Primary ID":128986,"Story ID":"STY1660836445","User Primary ID":76178,"User ID":"USR1660823997","Gender":null,"Age":22,"Title":"My kid be looking so cute","Narrative":"So cute \ud83d\udc95","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166083608286879.png","Account Created Date":"2022-08-18 17:29:57","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-08-18","Interest":"love u beta","Sports Events":"Islamic Solidarity Games, European Sports Championships","Associated Film Festivals":"Melbourne International Film Festival 2022, Sarajevo Film Festival 2022, Edinburgh International Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_3","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1128.48,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":363.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":12.56,"New COVID Cases":15754.0,"New Deaths":47.0,"New Vaccinations":3764791.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"BLACKPINK -

Not only should it provide an accurate portrayal of the LGBTQ community, but it also helps to normalize these relationships for children. This can help remove some of the stigma associated with being LGBTQ, and make it easier for them to come out later on in life.\nSome might argue that Disney already features a diverse range of characters within its storylines, so why bother adding LBGTQ+ characters? Well, there are a few reasons why this is important. For one thing, many young people don't see themselves represented accurately in popular culture; they need positive role models to look up to. Secondly, many kids who are LGTBQ+ may feel isolation or loneliness because they don't identify as 'completely straight' or 'completely gay.' Having mainstream media representations of those experiences can be very therapeutic - especially if those representations happen during childhood\/ adolescence when memories are still fresh.\nSo what specific examples do we have from Disney's recent history of inclusive content? Not many.\nAll across Hollywood studios, LGBTQ representation is slowly but surely starting to change for the better thanks to pressure from allies and LGBTQ+ groups. If Disney could take some simple steps toward correcting these issues now instead of waiting until public outrage forces them into action later on...

This could have been the spark that started a new civil war, and no one would have won there. That would have been good for no one.\u201d\n\nVan Tatenhove appeared at a Tuesday hearing in Washington alongside Stephen Ayres, a former Trump supporter from Ohio who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge related to infiltrating the Capitol on 6 January 2021.\n\nBoth of them discussed former allegiances and lessons learned after Congress was raged by a mob that Trump told to \u201cfight like hell\u201d in service of his lie that his defeat by Joe Biden was the result of electoral fraud.\n\nAyres said his realization Trump lied was akin to having \u201chorse blinders\u201d removed. He also spoke about what his belief had cost him.\nVan Tatenhove described efforts by Stewart Rhodes \u2013 the Oath Keepers leader now charged with seditious conspiracy \u2013 to sharpen his public image.\n\nRhodes \u201cwas always looking for ways to legitimize what he was doing,\u201d Van Tatenhove said, \u201cwrapping it in the trappings of, \u2018It\u2019s not a militia, it\u2019s a community preparedness team \u2026 an educational outreach group, it\u2019s a veteran support group.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut again, we\u2019ve got to stop with this dishonesty and the mincing of words and just call things for what they are.

usual niceties. In what was\nanother forgettable evening in a season of forgettable evenings, United barely inflicted any\ndamage on Everton's backline. Cristiano Ronaldo however, probably inflicted more damage\nonto an Everton fan's mobile phone following the match.\n\nThe video that has emerged involves Ronaldo walking down the tunnel at Goodison Park,\nbut it remains unclear as to what Ronaldo smashed was a phone.

How very typical of British\nfans. Ragnick's team have just won once in their last 5 games in England's top tier. Despite\nCR7 and Marcus Rashford returning to United's team sheet, Everton recorded a 1-0 victory\nthat might just prove to be the difference between daylight and relegation for them.\n\nRalf Ragnick was at the centre of most of the insults being thrown at United for his team\nselection versus Leicester. If anything, a change in team sheets didn't seem to change much\nas United barely got anything out of this game. It's just one of those defeats you can't stand\nfor, because It's unacceptable for United to play the way they have done on the business\nend of the season.\n\nIf at all the allegations thrown at Ronaldo are true, his acts will not go unnoticed and it will\nrequire impending investigation by the FA, probably even a fine. If not, well that's just what\nhappens to Ronaldo week in week out.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-164952459257775.png","Account Created Date":"2022-03-01 16:06:48","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-03-01","Interest":"cristiano ronaldo, everton, marcus rashford, football, news","Sports Events":"Six Nations","Associated Film Festivals":null,"Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1062.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":332.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":37.84,"New COVID Cases":7554.0,"New Deaths":223.0,"New Vaccinations":1495732.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J.

people romanticise the notion of donating blood as a noble cause as you can save someone's life by doing it. Even I had this thought when I went for donating the blood in the camp that was held in my college. But when I enquire about it from the team of young doctors there, they explained to me that donating blood is not used for a single patient but the red blood cells, white blood cells and plasma can be used to treat many patients. This explanation made me realise that the romanticization of blood donation has not too far away from reality. \n\nNow, feeling even more excited I went for the pre-test to determine my blood group after that I had to wait for a couple of minutes as both the bed were occupied. But finally, the time came when I was about to give my blood for the first time in my life. Dr. Asked me to lie down in a semi-sitting position and put a single in hand, it hurt a little but I went with it, the entire process just took half an hour but felt completely worth it. I also got a don't card which will work across India for the case where I need blood for myself, the card will ensure that I get it for free of cost. Plus I also got a cool mug with blood doner written on it.\n\nTo sum it up, blood donation might appear as scary for some people but at the end of the day, it's worth it.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-1655195272263.png","Account Created Date":"2021-09-21 13:30:08","Date (No Timestamp)":"2021-09-21","Interest":"world blood donor day, Health, active solidarity","Sports Events":"UCI Road World Championships","Associated Film Festivals":"Helsinki International Film Festival, San Sebastian Film Festival, Haifa International Film Festival","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2021_3","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1067.47,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":306.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":76.089996,"New COVID Cases":26964.0,"New Deaths":383.0,"New Vaccinations":9603746.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME - Official Teaser Trailer (HD)","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Sony Pictures Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Entertainment","YouTube Trending Video Views":67616001.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":2751593.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Often people romanticise the notion of donating blood as a noble cause as you can save someone s life by doing it Even I had this thought when I went for donating the blood in the camp that was held in my college But when I enquire about it from the team of young doctors there they explained to me that donating blood is not used for a single patient but the red blood cells white blood cells and plasma can be used to treat many patients This explanation made me realise that the romanticization of blood donation has not too far away from reality Now feeling even more excited I went for the pre test to determine my blood group after that I had to wait for a couple of minutes as both the bed were occupied But finally the time came when I was about to give my blood for the first time in my life Dr Asked me to lie down in a semi sitting position and put a single in hand it hurt a little but I went with it the entire process just took half an hour but felt completely worth it I also got a don t card which will work across India for the case where I need blood for myself the card will ensure that I get it for free of cost Plus I also got a cool mug with blood doner written on it To sum it up blood donation might appear as scary for some people but at the end of the day it s worth it ","Translated Title":"My experience of blood donation","GeoTopic Name":"British Indian Ocean Territory","GeoTopic Latitude":-6.0,"GeoTopic Longitude":72.0,"caption_generation":"a man standing next to a pile of luggage .","object_recognition":"['mountain bike, all-terrain bike, off-roader', 'sandbar, sand bar']","toxicity":0.001028663,"severe_toxicity":0.0000025934,"obscene":0.0000899274,"identity_attack":0.0001281158,"insult":0.0002192503,"threat":0.0000296519,"sexual_explicit":0.0000546947},{"Dataset Index":49014,"Story Primary ID":142557,"Story ID":"STY1663103772","User Primary ID":28996,"User ID":"USR1647270911","Gender":"others","Age":19,"Title":"The forgotten horse and its abuse","Narrative":"Horse is probably the most forgotten animal when it comes to conversation revolving around animal abuse.\nHorse riding is cruel in a variety of ways. The first and most obvious way is that horses are forced to pull heavy loads over long distances, which can be extremely damaging to their muscles and bones. They also have to deal with the fact that they're often ridden bareback, which is extremely painful and dangerous.\nOther concerns include the fact that horses are routinely whipped and beaten when they make mistakes, or to control them forcing horses to run in extremely hot conditions or placing them in areas where they risk falling off a cliff or into water, which leads to them becoming aggressive and difficult to control. \nIn fact horses are subjected to force breeding and their offsprings are taken away from them as soon as possible to be sold off to a life of endless abuse.\nThese horses have no control over their own life because humans think we own them.

The only other goal in the match was scored by Sergio Ramos at the 57\u2019 mark.\u00a0\n\nThis victory was particularly important for Lionel Messi\u2019s personal trophy record as it is his 41st career trophy. He is now just 3 trophies away from overtaking Dani Alves who has won the most number of trophies by any footballer ever.\u00a0\n\nParis Saint Germain have had a very positive performance in the pre-season and their 4-0 win in the first official match of the season will definitely add to their confidence. Not to forget that Kylian Mbappe is yet to be added to this team.\u00a0\n\nPSG\u2019s new signing Vitinha was one of the many players who caught fans\u2019 attention tonight with his stellar performance. He is an absolute baller and a brilliant addition to PSG\u2019s midfield. PSG fans will definitely look forward to many more similar performances from him in days to come.\u00a0\n\nAs for PSG\u2019s two stars Lionel Messi and Neymar Jr, the duo has seemingly rebuilt their long-lost chemistry. Their understanding on the pitch is next level and it will only grow eventually. They are definitely reminding us of the sweet old FC Barcelona days.\u00a0\n\nImage credits: Paris Saint-Germain Twitter","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-165933920422585.png","Account Created Date":"2022-08-03 21:32:00","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-08-03","Interest":"#messi, #neymar, #football, #footballfan, #news, #frenchsupercup","Sports Events":"Commonwealth Games, IFAF Women's American Football Championships","Associated Film Festivals":"Locarno Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_3","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1128.48,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":363.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":10.32,"New COVID Cases":0.0,"New Deaths":0.0,"New Vaccinations":0.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"BLACKPINK X PUBG MOBILE - \u2018Ready For Love\u2019 M\/V","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"BLACKPINK","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Music","YouTube Trending Video Views":39608431.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":3793940.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"Paris Saint Germain took on FC Nantes in the French Super Cup Troph e des Champions final tonight at Israel s Bloomfield Stadium and they registered a dominating win to lift the first trophy of the season Head coach Christophe Galtier used a formation with Lionel Messi Neymar and Pablo Sarabia upfront as Kylian Mbappe was not a part of tonight s squad and it did wonders for the french side Lionel Messi scored a wonder right footed goal after dribbling past the goalkeeper at the mark and opened PSG s tally for the night It was followed by a sensational free kick by Neymar right before Half time He got his second goal of the night in the second half after converting a poorly taken penalty The only other goal in the match was scored by Sergio Ramos at the mark This victory was particularly important for Lionel Messi s personal trophy record as it is his st career trophy He is now just trophies away from overtaking Dani Alves who has won the most number of trophies by any footballer ever Paris Saint Germain have had a very positive performance in the pre season and their win in the first official match of the season will definitely add to their confidence Not to forget that Kylian Mbappe is yet to be added to this team PSG s new signing Vitinha was one of the many players who caught fans attention tonight with his stellar performance He is an absolute baller and a brilliant addition to PSG s midfield PSG fans will definitely look forward to many more similar performances from him in days to come As for PSG s two stars Lionel Messi and Neymar Jr the duo has seemingly rebuilt their long lost chemistry Their understanding on the pitch is next level and it will only grow eventually They are definitely reminding us of the sweet old FC Barcelona days Image credits Paris Saint Germain Twitter","Translated Title":"Match Report: Messi and Neymar shine as PSG defeat Nantes 4-0 to win the 2022 Troph\u00e9e des Cham","GeoTopic Name":"Paris","GeoTopic Latitude":48.85341,"GeoTopic Longitude":2.3488,"caption_generation":"a group of people standing next to a motorcycle .","object_recognition":"['lakeside, lakeshore', 'swing']","toxicity":0.0012152073,"severe_toxicity":0.000001196,"obscene":0.0000275478,"identity_attack":0.0002435338,"insult":0.0002675598,"threat":0.0000332846,"sexual_explicit":0.0000181196},{"Dataset Index":72981,"Story Primary ID":149481,"Story ID":"STY1664207635","User Primary ID":69196,"User ID":"USR1659890543","Gender":"female","Age":22,"Title":"revisiting -Jurassic World: Dominion","Narrative":"If Steven Spielberg\u2019s Jurassic Park (1993) was an incredible dinner feast you had at a Friday night party, then the Jurassic World: Dominion is the heated leftovers of the same dinner, the morning after.\nHollywood has realised that nostalgia is a profitable commodity. But sequels often succumb to being a generic, forgettable clone of the originals. That is the biggest problem of Colin Trevorrow's Jurassic World: Dominion. It feels like the reheated leftovers of Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park (1993).\nSure, it will satisfy your hunger if you don\u2019t have anything else to consume. However, it just doesn\u2019t taste the same. \nJurassic World: Dominion opens with a montage of news reports, delving into how the world has changed since the dinosaurs were unleashed. Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) has come a long way from managing Jurassic World to being an advocate for dinosaur protection. The film also has a corporate thriller story going on, parallel to this.\nHere, the eccentric Biosyn CEO Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott) presents the necessary antagonistic force, orchestrating not only the locust disaster but also, the kidnapping of Maisie and the raptor baby. \nThe story is ambitious in its intentions but its execution simply delivers a very superficial treatment of all the themes. The plotting is weak, since the story attempts to cover a lot of things and ends up stretching itself too thin. There is no enduring depth to any of the narratives going on in Jurassic World: Dominion.\nThe film completely ignores the long-drawn-out terrifying elements of Jurassic Park. Instead, it bombards the audience with one dinosaur chase\/fight sequence after another, in quick succession. As a result, none of the dinosaurs feel truly magical or even terrifying. That is a huge let-down, considering that Spielberg managed to evoke a sense of true wonder and dread with his dinosaurs.\nThe story of Jurassic World: Dominion seems to affect the performances of the actors as well. Sam Neil looks confused and embarrassed, for the most of the time, to be part of this ludicrous band-wagon. Chris Pratt seems to repeat what he mostly does in almost every movie that he is in.

He's fast, he's big, and he can find the net's corner even when his eyes are closed. He also has a track record of delivering when it matters the most. Dortmund had a difficult season last year, but imagine how much worse it would have been if they hadn't had this truly world-class talent leading the line.\n\nKarim Benzema (Real Madrid)\nAfter all, in the 2010s, BBC was the main attraction in Madrid, and Benzema was a key member of that trio. The Frenchman hasn't slowed down over the years, leading from the front with power, hard-running, exceptional passing, and, as Chelsea found out the hard way last season, an unteachable eye for goal.

The Chinese government thinks so. The agency that regulates sports in China has banned national footballers from sporting tattoos. It has also asked those who have tattoos to cover up while playing.\n \nThe General Administration of Sport of China (GAS) has that once the Chinese Football Association implements it, the move will \"strengthen football players' lives, training and competition management\", and demonstrate \"positive spirit\" and \"set a good example for society.\" (https:\/\/mothership.sg\/2021\/12\/remove-tattoos-football-china\/)\n \nWhile the national players or seniors can cover their tattoos when playing, the regulator wants to send a stern warning to youngsters. For instance, players in the national and U-23 teams have been \"strictly forbidden\" to have new tattoos. \n \nFor U-20 national teams and lower national teams, GAS has said that they will not recruit youngsters with tattoos at all. \n \nBody ink in Chinese culture is often associated with criminals and organised gangs. And with many players sporting tattoos, the government want sports persons to be \"good examples\" for the people who watch them on television. The authorities have not limited themselves to tattoos. For instance, in 2020, a women's university match was called off after players of Fuzhou University were told they could not play with dyed hair and they were forced to forfeit the game. (https:\/\/www.scmp.com\/lifestyle\/fashion-beauty\/article\/3113387\/ban-womens-soccer-team-over-dyed-hair-revives-debate-china)\n \nChinese netizens are divided on the issue of regulators banning players for tattoos, hair dye or even weird hairstyles. Questioning the rationality, some on the Chinese social media platform, Sina Weibo, said that it didn't make sense to focus on \"trivial things\" as long as players played well and won matches. But the Chinese government thinks differently.

Resurgent India : Mathematical contributions of ancient India to the world","Narrative":"Prologue continues......\n\nGreat advancement took place during the early centuries of the Christian era which revolutionized the worlds of astronomy and mathematics. The zero was invented by Indians. So was the decimal place value system. The significance of these inventions to modern mathematics is inestimable. Aryabhata, born in AD 476, was a mathematician and astronomer whose seminal work in these fields brought great fame to India. \n\nHe made radical departures in traditional mathematics by the use of the decimal system and trigonometry. He invented ideas and measurements in astronomy. Aryabhata, for the first time, explained to the world that the lunar and solar eclipses are the results respectively of the earth\u2019s shadow Falling on the moon and the moon\u2019s shadow obscuring the sun. He also challenged the traditional view that the sun was orbiting around the earth and established that the earth was revolving around the sun. Twelve centuries before Issac Newton (17th century) discovered the force of gravity, Aryabhata identified it as responsible for objects not being thrown out as the earth rotated at great speed. Aryabhata was followed by Bhaskara (AD 522) and Brahmagupta (AD 628) who rose to great heights by their brilliant innovations in mathematics and astronomy. \n\nThe Mauryan and Gupta empires consolidated political power in a major part of India. These were extremely powerful and stable empires under which the cultural life of India blossomed. Its fragrance reached far and wide. These were periods of unsurpassed growth in literature, art, science and religion. The creative mind of India exploded, dazzling the world. \n\nThe six centuries before the birth of Christ stand out as a shining beacon in the history of ancient India as this period saw the emergence of Buddhism and Jainism, the two religions that churned up the Indian mind in an unprecedented way. Buddha, in fact, rescued the Indian mind from the morass of empty Brahminical ritualism into which it had sunk.

Former footballer turned pundit Roy Keene was disappointed with how Ten Hag has utilized CR7 following the game and the former United captain let his feelings known on air. \nSpeaking on Sky Sports, Roy Keene said, \"United are showing disrespect to Ronaldo. I think he should have been let go this summer during the transfer window. I don\u2019t think the manager should have held onto him just for him to sit on the bench. He is one of the greatest players ever and he had the option to leave this summer. The idea that he had no options is rubbish. He had four or five very good options.\"\nManchester City were clearly the better side in the derby as they went into the break with a 4-0 lead. Many Manchester United fans left the Etihad Stadium even before the halftime whistle after seeing United's shambolic performance. \nThough Roy Keene did not mention the \"four or five\" clubs that Cristiano Ronaldo had offers for. It is a well-known fact that CR7 wanted to leave in the summer. The Portuguese striker has just started 1 Premier League game under Erik Ten Hag this season. It has to be seen if the loss in the Manchester derby forces the manager to include Ronaldo in the starting XI for the next game.

The most vocal opposition to Russia\u2019s hosting has come from Britain, which could supply one or both of the final\u2019s participants.

With both clubs chasing the championship \u2013 United, a third in succession \u2013 this encounter promised to be a title decider.\nIn the opening rounds, the two sides traded punches; early on, Arsenal\u2019s rapid winger Marc Overmars ran onto Dennis Bergkamp\u2019s perfectly weighted chip, sashaying past a lunging Peter Schmeichel and firing extremely close from an impossibly tight angle.\nNot long after, Emmanuel Petit galloped forwards before playing a piercing through ball. Overmars, sprinting outside United\u2019s 19-year-old right back John Curtis, attempted to seize the pass and was tripped by the young defender inside the box although no penalty was given. Next, Overmars charged into the penalty area with the ball, bursting into space from between Curtis and Gary Neville but only finding the side netting. Such was the winger\u2019s dominance that Curtis was substituted after half-time.\nThe Gunners\u2019 unsung hero was goalkeeper Alex Manninger. In the first half, after Lee Dixon carelessly surrendered possession, Manninger spectacularly denied Teddy Sheringham and was again called into action as Andrew Cole latched onto Schmeichel\u2019s punt upfield. The flag stayed down as Cole raced into the box but Manninger made another critical save.\nThe winner came eleven minutes from time. A long ball was weakly flicked on by Bergkamp and then Nicolas Anelka into the path of Overmars, who controlled with his own head before stabbing it home through Schmeichel\u2019s legs. Incredibly, it was Arsenal\u2019s first Premier League goal at Old Trafford.\nIt was also the moment the Gunners decisively wrested control of the title race from Manchester United. From then on, Arsenal would win a further eight games consecutively to make it ten in a row, reeling in United to win their first top-flight title for seven years. Given how he monopolised his side\u2019s attacking threat in this game, Overmars\u2019 individual display remains one of the greatest of the Premier League era.\nAfter clinching the league, Arsenal beat Newcastle United 2-0 in the FA Cup final, goals from Overmars and Anelka winning the Gunners\u2019 first double for 27 years.","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-166254651487858.png","Account Created Date":"2022-09-02 20:03:58","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-09-02","Interest":"Sports, arsenal football club","Sports Events":"World Volleyball Championships (men), US Open","Associated Film Festivals":"Venice International Film Festival 2022, Telluride Film Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_3","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1128.48,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":363.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":11.22,"New COVID Cases":7219.0,"New Deaths":33.0,"New Vaccinations":2309439.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"BLACKPINK - \u2018Pink Venom\u2019 M\/V","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"BLACKPINK","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Music","YouTube Trending Video Views":240757307.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":12502699.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"One of the most iconic Premier League games of the nineties saw Arsenal taking on Manchester United at Old Trafford in March With both clubs chasing the championship United a third in succession this encounter promised to be a title decider In the opening rounds the two sides traded punches early on Arsenal s rapid winger Marc Overmars ran onto Dennis Bergkamp s perfectly weighted chip sashaying past a lunging Peter Schmeichel and firing extremely close from an impossibly tight angle Not long after Emmanuel Petit galloped forwards before playing a piercing through ball Overmars sprinting outside United s year old right back John Curtis attempted to seize the pass and was tripped by the young defender inside the box although no penalty was given Next Overmars charged into the penalty area with the ball bursting into space from between Curtis and Gary Neville but only finding the side netting Such was the winger s dominance that Curtis was substituted after half time The Gunners unsung hero was goalkeeper Alex Manninger In the first half after Lee Dixon carelessly surrendered possession Manninger spectacularly denied Teddy Sheringham and was again called into action as Andrew Cole latched onto Schmeichel s punt upfield The flag stayed down as Cole raced into the box but Manninger made another critical save The winner came eleven minutes from time A long ball was weakly flicked on by Bergkamp and then Nicolas Anelka into the path of Overmars who controlled with his own head before stabbing it home through Schmeichel s legs Incredibly it was Arsenal s first Premier League goal at Old Trafford It was also the moment the Gunners decisively wrested control of the title race from Manchester United From then on Arsenal would win a further eight games consecutively to make it ten in a row reeling in United to win their first top flight title for seven years Given how he monopolised his side s attacking threat in this game Overmars individual display remains one of the greatest of the Premier League era After clinching the league Arsenal beat Newcastle United in the FA Cup final goals from Overmars and Anelka winning the Gunners first double for years ","Translated Title":"Remembering Arsenal's 1-0 win at Old Trafford in 1997-98 Premier League title decider","GeoTopic Name":"Manchester","GeoTopic Latitude":53.41667,"GeoTopic Longitude":-2.25,"caption_generation":"a car driving down a city street at night .","object_recognition":"['mosque']","toxicity":0.023981532,"severe_toxicity":0.0000200095,"obscene":0.0030692127,"identity_attack":0.0011575393,"insult":0.007406508,"threat":0.0001799231,"sexual_explicit":0.0008526488},{"Dataset Index":56223,"Story Primary ID":111172,"Story ID":"STY1656600519","User Primary ID":33311,"User ID":"USR1650643193","Gender":null,"Age":31,"Title":"The UK government must cut down energy bills and insulate more homes, a report states.","Narrative":"According to Official advisors, the Climate Change Committee says the government's current insulation policy is \"shocking\".

There is a lot of violence and threats involved in this. \n\nPETA, whose motto is the phrase \"animals are not ours to use for amusement,\" points out that elephants employed in polo games, rides, or other forms of entertainment are subjected to rigorous training sessions in which they are often abused.

L'essere diventato il giocatore che ha segnato pi\u00f9 gol nella storia del club, superando anche Diego Armando Maradona, non gli garantisce il rinnovo certo, anzi secondo alcune voci pare che il presidente De Laurentiis possa dire addio anche all'attaccante belga al termine della stagione, oltre al capitano Lorenzo Insigne che ha gi\u00e0 firmato con il Toronto. Mertens, che ha 34 anni, spera ancora di poter firmare e rimanere nella citt\u00e0 che lo ha adottato in tutto e per tutto.\n\n\"So che esiste la possibilit\u00e0 di un addio\", ha detto Dris intervistato, \"io sono qua, c'\u00e8 un'opzione a favore del club e aspetto: poi si vedr\u00e0. Nel momento in cui sar\u00e0 inevitabile salutarsi, a casa Mertens piangeranno tutti: io, Kat e anche il bambino\". Un modo per rimanere ci sarebbe secondo Mertens e al momento ci sta provando in tutti i modi: \"Ho un solo modo per convincere De Laurentiis (a proporre un nuovo contratto, ndr): segnare tanto, cos\u00ec sar\u00e0 costretto a tenermi. Pi\u00f9 gol far\u00f2, pi\u00f9 capir\u00e0 che varr\u00e0 la pena farmi firmare\".\n\nInfine una battuta: \"\"Ho anche un asso nella manica, invece che spendere per un attaccante nuovo gli concedo di tesserare mio figlio (nascita attesa per marzo, ndr): centravanti giovane, con lunga carriera davanti a s\u00e9.

Restrictions on navigation in the Azov Sea and the closure of ports have interrupted grain shipments from Russia, the world\u2019s largest wheat exporter, and economic sanctions are complicating purchase agreements.\n\nAmid concerns about meeting food needs at home, Ukraine \u2013 which, together with Russia, supplies almost one-third of the world\u2019s traded wheat \u2013 has banned wheat exports. This turmoil in world wheat markets has resulted in a price increase of more than 50% since the invasion began.\n\nThis is a particular concern for countries like Egypt, which relies on imported wheat to meet over half its needs. Russia and Ukraine are Egypt\u2019s largest suppliers of wheat: In the 2020-2021 season, they provided 85% of the country\u2019s imports.\n\nTo understand what is at stake, one must appreciate how bread is so much a part of Egyptians\u2019 daily lives. Building on ethnographic work that I have conducted in Egypt since 2007, my forthcoming book, \u201cStaple Security: Bread and Wheat in Egypt,\u201d examines the anxieties that pervade Egyptian society over the possibility that their nation could run out of wheat, or that they might not have decent bread to eat.\n\nEgyptians work hard to ensure that there is always good bread available. The government purchases grain for a vast subsidized bread program. People visit bakeries daily to buy cheap bread. In rural areas, some women bake at home. The availability and quality of bread is an existential concern both for the state, which has long bolstered its legitimacy by providing this basic need, and for the people, most of whom eat bread three times a day.\n\nStaple foods make the meal\n\nIn 2008 when I was doing fieldwork in Egypt, there were severe shortages in the supply of government-subsidized bread, as well as lines at bakeries and high flour prices. Conversations turned frequently to bread.

Only 1.63% (9,176,657) of the global cases and 2.73% (173,888) of global deaths recorded were from the African continent \u2013 which has around 17% of the world\u2019s population.\nMultiple reasons for the slower spread have been put forward. One was that the continent\u2019s population is relatively young and younger people were at lower risk of severe illness in the event of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The possible contribution of pre-existing immunity from other viral infections was also put forward. And it was suggested that the slower spread might not be the real picture: there could be underestimation of the true magnitude of the pandemic, resulting from weak surveillance systems.\nThere is another aspect to consider, though. It is possible that what countries did to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections actually worked to some extent. Diverse sectors and disciplines collaborated towards the shared goal of mitigating the pandemic effects.\nIn our recent study we traced policies retrospectively and related them to patterns of the disease. We set out to understand how the 47 countries forming the World Health Organisation (WHO) African region coordinated the response to COVID-19 \u2013 and what we could learn from their strategies. By coordination we mean management to ensure unity of effort.\nOur analysis showed that decentralisation strategies and innovation played key roles in coordination. Financing was a challenge to coordination.\nRead more: https:\/\/theconversation.com\/how-african-countries-coordinated-the-response-to-covid-19-lessons-for-public-health-187299","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-16611529881404.png","Account Created Date":"2022-04-20 11:35:32","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-04-20","Interest":"Technology, History, Science, Food, Inequality, Entertainment, Education, Sports, Health, Environment, Politics, Economy, Climate change , the conversation","Sports Events":"Invictus Games, World Snooker Championship","Associated Film Festivals":"Pan African Film & Arts Festival 2022","Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_2","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1110.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":347.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":30.76,"New COVID Cases":2380.0,"New Deaths":56.0,"New Vaccinations":744947.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Watch the uncensored moment Will Smith smacks Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, drops F-bomb","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"Guardian News","YouTube Trending Video Category":"News & Politics","YouTube Trending Video Views":97122193.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":1427129.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"en","Title TikaDetect":"en","Narrative LangDetect":"en","Title LangDetect":"en","Translated Narrative":"How African countries coordinated the response to COVID lessons for public health The COVID pandemic spread much slower on the African continent than in the rest of the world contrary to predictions As of July a total of COVID confirmed cases and deaths had been recorded globally Only of the global cases and of global deaths recorded were from the African continent which has around of the world s population Multiple reasons for the slower spread have been put forward One was that the continent s population is relatively young and younger people were at lower risk of severe illness in the event of SARS CoV infection The possible contribution of pre existing immunity from other viral infections was also put forward And it was suggested that the slower spread might not be the real picture there could be underestimation of the true magnitude of the pandemic resulting from weak surveillance systems There is another aspect to consider though It is possible that what countries did to slow the spread of SARS CoV infections actually worked to some extent Diverse sectors and disciplines collaborated towards the shared goal of mitigating the pandemic effects In our recent study we traced policies retrospectively and related them to patterns of the disease We set out to understand how the countries forming the World Health Organisation WHO African region coordinated the response to COVID and what we could learn from their strategies By coordination we mean management to ensure unity of effort Our analysis showed that decentralisation strategies and innovation played key roles in coordination Financing was a challenge to coordination Read more ","Translated Title":"How African countries coordinated the response to\u00a0COVID-19: lessons for public\u00a0health\n\nThe COVID-19","GeoTopic Name":null,"GeoTopic Latitude":null,"GeoTopic Longitude":null,"caption_generation":"a group of men standing next to each other .","object_recognition":"['stage', 'microphone, mike']","toxicity":0.0004943662,"severe_toxicity":0.0000010688,"obscene":0.0000302376,"identity_attack":0.0000656755,"insult":0.0001521959,"threat":0.0000150383,"sexual_explicit":0.0000123898},{"Dataset Index":9626,"Story Primary ID":91135,"Story ID":"STY1648725923","User Primary ID":8606,"User ID":"USR1630490247","Gender":"male","Age":13,"Title":"79.

Eccettuate le zone con documentazione storica, gli archeologi disponevano di solo questo tipo di cronologia relativa, di per s\u00e9 abbastanza elastica, fino al 1949, quando l'invenzione del metodo del radiocarbonio o Carbonio-14 (14 C), rese possibile datare i resti di natura organica e di conseguenza i sedimenti originari.

La dendrocronologia, vale a dire il metodo di datazione tramite gli anelli di accrescimento degli alberi, ha contribuito a risolvere il problema. Facendo riferimento a un gran numero di alberi, gli scienziati hanno elaborato sequenze di anelli che risalgono fino a oltre il 7500 a.C. Confrontandole date fornite dal metodo radiocarbonico applicato al legno delle piante con l'et\u00e0 effettiva di ciascuna pianta determinata tramite la dendrocronologia, gli scienziati hanno elaborato una tavola di conversione delle date radiometriche in date effettive di calendario.\n\nFonte: l\u2019Archeologia, biblioteca illustrata del sapere","Media":"https:\/\/image.pixstory.com\/Pixstory-image-164900069876933.jpeg","Account Created Date":"2022-01-17 20:50:36","Date (No Timestamp)":"2022-01-17","Interest":"archeologia, storia","Sports Events":"Africa Cup of Nations, Australian Open","Associated Film Festivals":null,"Hate Speech Flag":0.0,"Hate Speech Detected":null,"Year_Quarter":"2022_1","Snapchat_Quarterly_Revenue":1062.0,"Snapchat_Quarterly_DAUs":332.0,"Snapchat_Closing_Stock_Price":38.040001,"New COVID Cases":238018.0,"New Deaths":310.0,"New Vaccinations":5167283.0,"YouTube Trending Video Title":"Adele - Oh My God (Official Video)","YouTube Trending Video Channel":"AdeleVEVO","YouTube Trending Video Category":"Music","YouTube Trending Video Views":24158572.0,"YouTube Trending Video Likes":858555.0,"is_sarcastic":1.0,"Narrative TikaDetect":"it","Title TikaDetect":"it","Narrative LangDetect":"it","Title LangDetect":"it","Translated Narrative":"In general, the dating of archaeological sites and objects is carried out by combining stratigraphy or the determination of the chronological sequence and typology, i.e. the identification of the typical artefacts of the different periods within this sequence.

Cervical JPS was evaluated using a cervical range of motion device in cervical flexion, extension, and rotation in left and right directions. Participants were required to relocate their heads actively to a predefined target position with eyes closed, and their reposition accuracy was measured in degrees as joint reposition error (JRE). The\u00a0HbA1c\u00a0test was performed on all participants with T2D to determine their average\u00a0blood sugar level\u00a0over the previous 2 to 3 months. Cervical JREs were compared and correlated with\u00a0HbA1c\u00a0values.\n\nResults\n\nThe participants with T2D showed significantly larger cervical JREs in all directions compared with the healthy group (flexion: d\u00a0=\u00a01.23,\u00a0P\u00a0< .001; extension: d\u00a0=\u00a01.85,\u00a0P\u00a0< .001; left rotation: d\u00a0=\u00a01.70,\u00a0P\u00a0< .001; right rotation: d\u00a0=\u00a02.60,\u00a0P\u00a0< .001).\u00a0Pearson correlation coefficient\u00a0(r) showed significant moderate positive association between HbA1c and cervical JREs in flexion (r\u00a0=\u00a00.41,\u00a0P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), extension (r\u00a0=\u00a00.48,\u00a0P\u00a0< .001), left rotation (r\u00a0=\u00a00.38,\u00a0P\u00a0< .001), and right rotation (r\u00a0=\u00a00.37,\u00a0P\u00a0< .001) in participants with T2D.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe magnitude of cervical JPS impairment was significant in individuals with T2D.

Furthermore, this isn't a one-time occurrence. Throughout the video, Wilkins is seen getting the better of Michael Jordan on several occasions. \n\nMoreover, Dominique Wilkins defeats Jordan on many occasions in a video dating back to 1986. Furthermore, despite Jordan protecting him, Wilkins dunks!
