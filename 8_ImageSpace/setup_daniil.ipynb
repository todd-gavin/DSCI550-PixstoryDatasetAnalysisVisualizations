    "# `INSTRUCTIONS FOR IMAGE SPACE SETUP`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1 - Download 80k images:\n",
    "1. Open file download_images.ipynb and run the code from top to bottom. 80,000+ images will begin to download in the 95k_Images folder.\n",
    "Use ls -1 | wc -l in 95k_Images to view download progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2 - Create a folder subset of 1,000 Images:\n",
    "1. /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n",
    "2. brew install coreutils\n",
    "3. Run this on 95k_Images to get a subset: find 95k_Images/ -type f -print0 | shuf -n 1000 -z | xargs -0 -I{} cp {} subset_images/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3 - Download Image Space repo:\n",
    "1. run this on 8_ImageSpace Folder: `git clone https://github.com/nasa-jpl-memex/image_space.git`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4 - Set environment variables:\n",
    "1. `export IMAGE_SPACE=/Users/daniilabbruzzese/Documents/Senior_Year/DSCI_550/assignment_3/DSCI550-PixstoryDatasetAnalysisVisualizations/8_ImageSpace/image_space`\n",
    "    - verify path: `echo $IMAGE_SPACE`\n",
    "2. `export IMAGE_DIR=/Users/daniilabbruzzese/Documents/Senior_Year/DSCI_550/assignment_3/DSCI550-PixstoryDatasetAnalysisVisualizations/8_ImageSpace/subset_images`\n",
    "    - verify path: `echo $IMAGE_DIR`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5 - Build your Neural Net (AlexNet) based features for the images.\n",
    "1. `cd \"$IMAGE_SPACE/imagespace_smqtk\" && ./smqtk_services.run_images.sh --docker-network deploy_imagespace-network --images \"$IMAGE_DIR\"`\n",
    "    - If having trouble, try to tear down the old network: `docker network prune`\n",
    "    - you should see `docker ps -a` showing NOTHING\n",
    "    - `docker network ls --no-trunc` showing NOTHING\n",
    "    - If all containers dont start (there should be 2), then break down the command into two parts and run seperately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6 - Run Neural Net\n",
    "1. Run neural net command: `cd $IMAGE_SPACE/scripts/deploy && IMAGE_DIR=$IMAGE_DIR docker-compose up -d`\n",
    "    - To run on M1 mac, refer to next markdown cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7 - Seeing if containers are working\n",
    "1. go to this site: http://localhost:8088/opsui and you should see the Apache OODT instance\n",
    "2. go to this site: http://localhost:64622/solr/#/imagecatdev/query and you should see the Apache Solr instance\n",
    "    - Need to check what number is associated with port 8081 on the imageCat docker container and change the `64622` number in the link to the matching port 8081 number\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8 - Run ImageSpace and start Querying\n",
    "1. `cd $IMAGE_SPACE/scripts/deploy && sh ./imagespace/enable-imagespace.sh`\n",
    "    - Visit this site http://localhost:8989/ and type in `*` into the search box.\n",
    "2. Click on an image and then select the button `Search By Similarity` to find similar pictures. \n"
