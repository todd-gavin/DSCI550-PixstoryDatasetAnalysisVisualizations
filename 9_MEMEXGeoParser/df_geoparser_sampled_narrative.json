The gynecologist and general practitioner have a fundamental role both in being able to provide information that is clear and non-alarmistic both in promoting access to hormone replacement therapy which, according to the survey, is offered to women about comforting that half of Italian women enter menopause naturally but a pity to note that many others suffer from disabling symptoms without truly effective help comments from the doctor Rossella Nappi Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics and head of the highly complex Menopause center of the IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo University of Pavia Research is providing us with very safe therapies based on hormones identical to those woman had before entering menopause to better counteract hot flashes night sweats and sleep disturbances that have a significant impact on daily life and sense of well-being",
