## Visualization #1: Bar Chart Race to represent Pixstory interest engagement over time and COVID cases (divided by 10,000) over time

#### Description:
We were curious to find out how Pixstory posts varied over time in terms of their related interests. We also wanted to see how COVID cases were developing along side this. The COVID data represents COVID cases in India, which we are using as an indicator for the total COVID cases in the world. **Note: COVID cases were divided by 10,000 in order to normalize the data to be comparable with the interest variables. This all racing bars on the bar chart to be relatively similar in size**

#### Some interesting findings: 
- During 2020, health was the most discussed interest by a long shot. This is likely due to the fact that the COVID pandemic was raging during this time.
- In January 2021 there was a large spike in posts from the “politics” interest, so much so that it overtook health and was the most popular interest on Pixstory at the time. We hypothesize that one contributing factor to this was the US capitol raid that occured on January 6, 2021. 
-  The Health topic spiked at the end of September 2021. This could be partially due to the abortion ban in Texas that was making news headlines during the time
- In 2022 sports spikes and takes lead in terms of most engaged with interest; health is no longer the favorite interest as COVID cases have vastly slowed down.

#### Summary of dataset preparation:
1. Imported master dataset and dropped all columns except Interest and Date
2. Created a bar graph that shows the most frequent interests appearing in posts. Decided to focus on top 6 interests: sports, health, entertainment, food, politics, and education
3. Used lambda function that converted the interest column into a list of strings and made all words lowercase to make the data easy to process
4. Created a function tally_interests that counted the total number of times each of the 6 top interests appeared for a given date
5. Created a new data frame where each column represents the number of times a given interest appeared in a post
6. Added new columns to the df that takes the cumulative value of tally_interest such that each row is the sum of the number of posts containing the given interest up until that date 
7. Created a COVID case df that found the cumulative number of COVID cases in India. 
    - Divided COVID cases by 10,000 in order to normalize the numbers to be comporable to Pixstory interest cumulative counts
9. Created a new df called df_observable to match the Observable template and sample data to allow for seamless import process
    - Renamed the columns to 'date', 'name', 'category', 'value' 
    - Reformatted the dataframe: for every day, each variable in the bar chart race now represents one row rather than being in a separate column. Thus, the same date will appear six times to represent each of the six interests. 
    - The category variable is going to be listed as 'Interest' for every row (it's only there as a placeholde to match the template, we are not interested in using different categories for this visualization)
    - Saving the dataframe as a CSV and JSON file

## Visualization #2: Language Counts Bar Chart

#### Description:
We decided to use a simple Hierarchial Bar Chart to understand the split of languages used (and identified) using Tika LangDetect in Assignment #2. This would allow us to take a deeper dive into the demographics reached by PixStory. 

#### Some Interesting Findings 
- Italian, Bengali and Catalan top the list after English. This is interesting because it does not seem like these languages are as widespread in the world/on the net as they are on PixStory. We expected French etc. to take over the list. 
- German, Slovakian, Slovenian, Danish, Dutch, all have very low counts (lower than 400) which points to the fact that PixStory may not be as popular in Europe, aside from Italy and Spain. 
- Hindi, Bengali, Afrikaans, Indonesian all have high counts, which point the fact that PixStory may target a demographic within less developed countries 

#### Summary of dataset preparation:
1. Imported master dataset and dropped all columns except Tika LangDetect
2. Applied .value_counts() to display counts of each language's instance detected
3. Output the counts for visualisation



## Visualization #3: Wordcloud of Pixstory Narrative

#### Description: 
We decided to use a Word Cloud to test our hypothesis, which was that if the most popular words used by posters were flagged by the sarcasm, hate speech or GLAAD flags we created in assignment 1, the dataset was more likely to be toxic.

#### Some Interesting Findings: 
We found the most popular words used were: “India”, “People”, “Afghanistan”, “County” and “Life” which showed us that Pixstory is not a toxic platform. 

#### Summary of dataset preparation:
1. Import pandas, ramdom, nltk, random, math and from nltk.corpus import stopwords
2. Run: nltk.download('punkt') to provide support for tokenization
3. Updated the dataframe to be sorted by 'Date (No Timestamp)'
4. Created subsets of 20k words
5. Created list of 3k words from each subset from the 'Translated Narrative' column
6. Removed the stopwords from the list 
7. Used the top 500 words from the list to create a word cloud

## Visualization #4: Topical Bubble Chart

#### Description: 
To dig deeper into the demographics and interests of PixStory users and how the platform was being used, we decided to create a bubble chart. The chart gave us an idea of the average age of posters for the most popular topics. 

#### Some Interesting Findings:
- Top interests among your audience are sports, entertainment, politics, health, food, environment, history, education, science, and inequality. 
- The average age for most interests is around 23-24 years.
- Bollywood-related interests are also popular in this dataset, including Bollywood, Bollywood Life, Bollywood Movies, Bollywood Music, and Bollywood Fashion.
- COVID-19 and mental health are also popular interests in this dataset.
- There are some interests that appear to have a lower sentiment score, including Taliban Government and Alt News.

#### Summary of dataset preparation:
1. Import CSV, pdandas, and statistics
2. Created a dictorinary to store interests, average age and count 
3. Sort interests by count in descending order

## Visualization #5: U.S. State Choropleth Chart to represent average toxicity across states

#### Description: 
We chose the visualization because we were curious to find out if the toxicity of posts varied accross different US states. This allowed us to make use of our toxicity features that we generated previously, and begin to answer questions around if Pixstory is accomplishing its goal as trying to be a clean social media. We found that the most toxic states are New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Kansas, and the least toxic states are Oregon, Nevada, and Wyoming. 

#### Summary of dataset preparation:
1. Created df that filters for just the Date, Geotopic name, and Toxicity columns. 
2. Created a list of all 50 states, then created a new df that only includes Geotopic names that match one of the 50 states. This creates a df that filters out all locations other than one of the 50 states.
3. Created a new df that groups by state and takes the mean of the toxicity such that each row is a unique state and its respective average toxicity
4. Added a column to rank states in terms of toxicity
5. Finally, renamed columns to match observable template: ("avg_toxicity" became "rate", "toxicity_rank" became "rank", "state" became "name")

## Report Questions
1. Why did you select your 5 D3 visualizations?
    -  For our visualizations, we decided to use a Word Cloud to test our hypothesis on the toxicity of PixStory, a Bubble Chart to dig deeper into the demographics and interests of our users, a US map to identify the most toxic states in terms of average toxicity of posts, a racing bar chart to gain insights into how interest engagement varried over time along side the COVID pandemic, and finally a hierarchical bar chart to better understand the proportion of narratives belonging to the different languages detected in assignment 2 on PixStory.
2. How are they answering and showing off your features from assignments 1 and 2 and the work you did?
    - By using features we created like Tika Lang Detect, Translated Narrative, and finding the average age of posters, we were able to use our data to determine if PixStory users were adhering to the platforms initiative of being a clean social media platform or not. Our analysis from assignments 1 to 3, has helped us prove that PixStory users are in fact adhering to the policies, and it is not a toxic platform. 
3. Did Image Space allow you to find any similarity between the Pixstory story images that previously was not easily discernible?
    - Yes, Image Space, with ease, could find similar pictures within the subset of images ingested into the Image Space Program. For example, upon selecting similarity for a soccer players photo, the Image Space program could easily related soccer player photos within the same subset of images selected from. However, with more obscure images, the program was not as succesful with finding seemingly "related" images; nonetheless, even with the more obscure images, Image Space did better than any person could on sifting throught e subset to find related images. 
4. What type of location data showed up in your data? Any correlations not previously seen, e.g., from assignment 1?
    - When using the Geoparser application, the location data was similar to what was parsed from assignments 1 and 2. This makes sense because the underlying Geoparser application uses the same lucene gazetteer to extract location data. However, in this case as we are using the full Geoparser application, we can easily visualize the concentration and frequency of the extract locations of narrative from the Pixstory social media dataset. Using the Geoparser application, we can easily search specific locations and see where each Narrative is associted with location.
5. Also include your thoughts about Image Space and ImageCat – what was easy about using them? What wasn’t?
    - The installation and setup of Image Space was diffcult, especially when trouble shooting the installation process of a Macbook M1 with ha sa arm64 chip instead of the recomended amd64/v8 chip. We believe that that Image Space repository should include more detialed instructions on trouble shooting the installation of Image Space and passible and index that describes in detial what certain errors mean. However, once the program was working, it was incredbily easy to navigate the application and find similar images.
